       hledger  is  a  cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
       other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a  simple,  editable
       file  format.   hledger  is  inspired  by  and  largely compatible with
       ledger(1).

       hledger-web is hledger's web interface.  It starts a simple web  appli-
       cation for browsing and adding transactions, and optionally opens it in
       a web browser window if possible.  It provides a more user-friendly  UI
       than  the  hledger  CLI  or  hledger-ui interface, showing more at once
       (accounts, the current account register, balance charts)  and  allowing
       history-aware data entry, interactive searching, and bookmarking.

       hledger-web  also  lets you share a ledger with multiple users, or even
       the public web.  There is no access control, so if you  need  that  you
       should  put  it  behind  a  suitable  web proxy.  As a small protection
       against data loss when running an unprotected  instance,  it  writes  a
       numbered backup of the main journal file (only ?)  on every edit.

       The  journal  file is ~/.hledger.journal, $LEDGER_FILE, or another file
       specified with -f.  For  more  about  the  format,  see  hledger(1)  or
       hledger_journal(5).

       By default, hledger-web starts the web app in "transient mode" and also
       opens it in your default web browser if possible.  In this mode the web
       app will keep running for as long as you have it open in a browser win-
       dow, and will exit after two minutes of inactivity (no requests and  no
       browser windows viewing it).

              $ hledger web
              Starting web app on port 5000 with base url http://localhost:5000
              Starting web browser if possible
              Web app will auto-exit after a few minutes with no browsers (or press ctrl-c)

       With  --server,  it  starts  the web app in non-transient mode and logs
       requests to the console.  Typically when running hledger web as part of
       a  website  you'll  want  to  use  --base-url to set the protocol/host-
       name/port/path to be used in hyperlinks.  The --file-url option  allows
       static  files  to be served from a different url, eg for better caching
       or cookie-less serving.

       You can use --port to listen on a different TCP port,  eg  if  you  are
       running  multiple  hledger-web instances.  This need not be the same as
       the PORT in the base url.

       Note there is no built-in access control, so  you  will  need  to  hide
       hledger-web behind an authenticating proxy (such as apache or nginx) if
       you want to restrict who can see and add entries to your journal.

       With journal and timeclock files (but not CSV files, currently) the web
       app detects changes and will show the new data on the next request.  If
       a change makes the file unparseable, hledger-web  will  show  an  error
       until the file has been fixed.

       Note:  if invoking hledger-web as a hledger subcommand, write -- before
       options as shown above.

       ----sseerrvveerr
              disable  browser-opening  and  auto-exit-on-idle,  and  log  all
              requests to stdout

       ----ppoorrtt==PPOORRTT
              set the TCP port to listen on (default: 5000)

       ----bbaassee--uurrll==UURRLL
              set  the  base  url (default: http://localhost:PORT).  You would
              change this when sharing over the network, or integrating within
              a larger website.

       ----ffiillee--uurrll==UURRLL
              set the static files url (default: BASEURL/static).  hledger-web
              normally serves static files itself, but if you wanted to  serve
              them  from  another server for efficiency, you would set the url
              with this.

       The following common hledger options should also work:

       --ff FFIILLEE ----ffiillee==FFIILLEE
              use a different input file.  For stdin, use -

       ----rruulleess--ffiillee==RRUULLEESSFFIILLEE
              Conversion  rules  file  to  use  when  reading  CSV   (default:
              FILE.rules)

       ----aalliiaass==OOLLDD==NNEEWW
              display accounts named OLD as NEW

       ----iiggnnoorree--aasssseerrttiioonnss
              ignore any failing balance assertions in the journal

       ----ddeebbuugg==NN
              show debug output if N is 1-9 (default: 0)

       --bb ----bbeeggiinn==DDAATTEE
              include postings/txns on or after this date

       --ee ----eenndd==DDAATTEE
              include postings/txns before this date

       --pp ----ppeerriioodd==PPEERRIIOODDEEXXPP
              set  start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
              (overrides the flags above)

       ----ddaattee22 ----aauuxx--ddaattee
              use postings/txns' secondary dates instead

       --CC ----cclleeaarreedd
              include only cleared postings/txns

       ----ppeennddiinngg
              include only pending postings/txns

       --UU ----uunncclleeaarreedd
              include only uncleared (and pending) postings/txns

       --RR ----rreeaall
              include only non-virtual postings

       ----ddeepptthh==NN
              hide accounts/postings deeper than N

       --EE ----eemmppttyy
              show empty/zero things which are normally omitted

       --BB ----ccoosstt
              show amounts in their cost price's commodity

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       LLEEDDGGEERR__FFIILLEE sets the default journal file path.   If  not  set,  it  is
       ~/.hledger.journal.

FFIILLEESS
       Reads   data   from   a   hledger   journal   file   ($LEDGER_FILE   or
       ~/.hledger.journal by default), or a CSV file plus associated CSV rules
       file.

BBUUGGSS
       The  need  to precede options with -- when invoked from hledger is awk-
       ward.

       -f- doesn't work (hledger-web can't read from stdin).

       Query arguments and some applicable  hledger  options  probably  aren't
       supported.

       Does not work in text-mode browsers.

       Does not work well on small screens.

       The auto-exit feature was added to avoid leaving stray processes, eg on
       Windows.  It is not well tested.

       If you start two instances on the same port, the second one will appear
       to  run  normally,  but  you will be seeing pages served from the first
       one.
