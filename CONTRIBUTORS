This is the official contributor agreement (v1) and contributor list
for the hledger project. If you have contributed non-trivial code
changes to hledger, please sign this, to help ensure:

2. that you get proper credit for your work

3. that we are able to remain license-compatible with related software
   by updating to newer versions of our license when appropriate
   (eg GPLv2 -> GPLv3)

To "sign", read the conditions below and then send a darcs patch to
this file_  adding your name to the Contributor List above.  By so
doing you promise that all of your commits to hledger:

- are free of patent violations or copyright violations, to the best of
  your knowledge

- are released under the hledger project's license_; or are released
  under another compatible license (in which case this must be clearly
  noted); or are public domain

  at the discretion of the project leader

We don't currently gather paper signatures, but this is a good start.
Feel free to update your entry as your contributions grow!
