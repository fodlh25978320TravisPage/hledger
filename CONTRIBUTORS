Contributor Agreement and List
##############################

hledger Contributor Agreement
=============================
This is the official contributor agreement, version 1, and contributor
list for the hledger project. If you have contributed code to hledger, you
should sign this, to help ensure:

1. that there is a clear audit trail and legal status for the project

2. that we are able to remain license-compatible with future versions of other
   free & open-source software packages, by updating to current versions
   of the license(s) when appropriate

3. that you get proper credit for your work.

How to sign
-----------
Send a darcs patch adding your name to the hledger Contributor List below.
By so doing you promise that all of your commits to hledger:

- are free of patent violations or copyright violations, to the best of
  your knowledge.

- are released under the hledger project's license (which is GNU GPL v3 or
  later); or are released under another compatible license (in which case
  this must be clearly noted); or are public domain.

- may be relicensed under official future versions of their license at the
  project leader's discretion, if that seems useful.
