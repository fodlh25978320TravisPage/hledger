This is the README for the site/ directory.

(Confusingly, README.md from the parent directory is also symlinked
here, to get it rendered as part of the website, and it might take
precedence when viewing this dir on github.)

Source files for the hledger.org website. 
To generate the website, run ./Shake website. 
This will add the web manuals' markdown to this directory, 
render all markdown as html, and copy static files, to site/_site/.
