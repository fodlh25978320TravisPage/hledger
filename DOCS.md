## Four kinds of documentation

<div style="margin:1em 2em; font-style:italic;">
"There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good
software documentation: there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation,
there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and
technical reference. They represent four different purposes or
functions, and require four different approaches to their creation."

Project documentation lives in a number of places:

- `site/*.md` is the hledger.org website content, which is generated with hakyll[-std] and pandoc
- haddock documentation in the code appears on Hackage
- short blurbs: cabal files, module headers, HCAR, GSOC project, ..
- `doc/notes.org` has some old developer notes
- developer reports (profiles, benchmarks, coverage..) in doc/profs, sometimes published at hledger.org/profs
