# This can be symlinked as hie.yaml to make hls use a different ghc version
# from the default stack.yaml.
#
# Eg mac m1 users could use it to select ghc 8.10,
# until there is a ghc-9-compatible arm hls binary.
# (Though, since such a binary is relatively easy to build yourself,
# and 2-3x faster, I recommend doing that instead.)

    # since there is a hie.yaml, these must be listed explicitly
