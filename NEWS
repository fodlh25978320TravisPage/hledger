2010/02/11 hledger 0.8
......................

  * parsing: in date=date2, use first date's year as a default for the second
  * add: ctrl-d doesn't work on windows, suggest ctrl-c instead
  * add: --no-new-accounts option disallows new accounts (Roman Cheplyaka)
  * add: re-use the previous transaction's date as default (Roman Cheplyaka)
  * add: a command-line argument now filters by account during history matching (Roman Cheplyaka)

  * register: make reporting intervals honour a display expression (#18)
  * web: fix help link
  * web: use today as default when adding with a blank date
  * web: re-enable account/period fields, they seem to be fixed, along with file re-reading (#16)
  * web: get static files from the cabal data dir, or the current dir when using make (#13)
  * web: preserve encoding during add, assuming it's utf-8 (#15)
  * fix some non-utf8-aware file handling (#15)
  * filter ledger again for each command, not just once at program start

........................

  * price history support (first cut):
    P directives now work, though differently from c++ ledger. Each
    posting amount takes its fixed unit price from the price history (or
    @) when available. This is simple and useful for things like foreign
    currency expenses (but not investment tracking). Like ledger, balance
    and register don't show amount prices any more, and don't separate
    differently-priced amounts. Unlike ledger, print shows all amount
    prices, and supports -B.
  * --effective option, will use transactions' effective dates if any
  * convert: new rules file format, find/create rules file automatically,
    more robust parsing, more useful --debug output
  * print: always sort by date, fix long account name truncation, align
    amounts, show end of line comments, show all amounts for clarity
    (don't elide the final balancing amount)
  * ui: use vty 4, fixes non-ascii and gnome terminal problems (issues #3, #4)
  * web: allow data entry, react to data file changes, better layout, help
    links, remove histogram command and filter fields for now, fix bad
    localhost redirect, filter form did not work in eg firefox (issue #7),
    reset link did not work in all browsers
  * parsing: require whitespace between date and status code, allow (and
    ignore) a time in price records, better error messages, non-zero exit
    code on parse failure
  * display non-ascii error messages properly (issue #5)
  * fix an arithmetic bug that occasionally rejected valid transactions
  * fix a regex bug in showtree
  * don't break if HOME is undefined
  * --debug now implies --verbose
  * add functional tests like ledger's, use test-framework for speedy
    running, release shelltestrunner as a separate package
  * many hlint cleanups (Marko KociÄ‡)
  * many site and documentation updates

2009/05/23 hledger 0.5.1
.................................

2009/05/23 hledger 0.5
...............................
