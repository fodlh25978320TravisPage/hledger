2009/01/17 hledger 0.3 released
...............................

Fixes:

  * count timelog sessions on the day they end, like ledger, for now
  * when options are repeated, use the last instead of the first
  * builds with ghc 6.10 as well as 6.8
  * runs much faster than 0.2:

    $ bench hledger-0.2 hledger ledger
                                      || hledger-0.2 | hledger | ledger
    ==================================++=============+=========+=======
    -f 2008.ledger -s balance         ||        2.59 |    0.26 |   0.11
    -f 10000entries.ledger -s balance ||      566.68 |    2.72 |   0.96

Features:

  * a simple ui for interactive report browsing: hledger ui
  * accept smart dates everywhere (YYYYMMDD, Y/M/D, Y, M/D, D, jan, today, last week etc.)
  * --period/-p flag accepting period expressions like "in 2008", "weekly from last month"..
  * -W/-M/-Y convenience flags to summarise register weekly, monthly, yearly
  * --depth and -E flags also affect summarised register reports (including depth=0)
  * --display/-d flag supporting date predicates (like "d<[DATE]", "d>=[DATE]")
  * !include directive to include additional ledger files
  * !account directive to set a default parent account
  * Added support for reading historical prices from files
  * timelog and ledger entries can be intermixed in one file
