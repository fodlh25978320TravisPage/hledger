2009/04/xx hledger 0.4 released
...............................

Changes:

  * avoid bulky/non-portable dependencies by default, curses ui now requires a build flag (-f vty)
  * on MS windows, provide a simple ansi-based ui in place of vty (-f ansi)
  * new "web" command starts a webserver and shows filterable reports in a browser (-f happs)
  * drop the --options-anywhere flag, that is now the default
  * patterns now use not: and desc: prefixes instead of ^ and ^^
  * patterns are now case-insensitive, like ledger
  * !include directives are now relative to the including file (Tim Docker)
  * "Y2009" default year directives are now supported, allowing m/d dates in ledger
  * individual transactions now have a cleared status
  * unbalanced entries are now reported properly
  * balance report now passes all ledger compatibility tests
  * balance report now shows subtotals by default, like ledger 3
  * show the balance report's zero total when -E is used
  * --no-total hides balance report's final total
  * --depth affects print and register reports (aggregating with a reporting interval, filtering otherwise)
  * register command sorts transactions by date
  * -E works in register report
  * provide more convenient timelog querying when invoked as "hours"
  * multi-day timelog sessions are split at midnight
  * unterminated timelog sessions are now counted. Accurate time reports at last!
  * the test command gives better --verbose output
  * --version gives more detailed version numbers including patchlevel for dev builds
  * haddock & hoogle docs now include optional build components
  * new make targets include: ghci, haddocktest, doctest, unittest, view-api-docs
  * a doctest-style framework for functional/shell tests has been added
  * performance has decreased slightly::
