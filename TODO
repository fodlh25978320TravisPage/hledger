* feature: balance report account matching

sample account tree:

assets
 cash
 checking
 saving
equity
expenses
 food
 shelter
income
 salary
liabilities
 debts

standard balance command shows all top-level accounts:

> ledger bal
$ assets      
$ equity
$ expenses    
$ income      
$ liabilities 

with an account pattern, show only the ones with matching names:

> ledger bal asset
$ assets      

with -s, show all subaccounts of matched accounts:

> ledger -s bal asset
$ assets      
$  cash       
$  checking   
$  saving

again:

> ledger bal a
$ assets      
$  cash       
$  saving
$ income      
$  salary     
$ liabilities 

and including subaccounts:

> ledger -s bal a
$ assets      
$  cash       
$  checking   
$  saving
$ income      
$  salary     
$ liabilities 
$  debts

but also, elide boring accounts whenever possible, so if savings is 0 and
income/liabilities have no transactions the above would be displayed as:

> ledger -s bal a
$ assets      
$  cash       
$  checking   
$ income:salary
$ liabilities:debts

algorithm:

1 filter account tree by name, keeping any necessary parents
2 add subaccounts if -s
3 display account tree, eliding boring accounts

include subaccounts
elide boring accounts












optimization: add CookedLedger caching acct txns, boring status etc.
 refactor apis
