Most data types are defined here to avoid import cycles. See the
corresponding modules for each type's documentation.

A note about entry\/transaction\/posting terminology:

  - ledger 2 had Entrys containing Transactions.
  
  - hledger 0.4 had Entrys containing RawTransactions, plus Transactions
    which were a RawTransaction with its parent Entry's info added.
    The latter are what we most work with when reporting and are
    ubiquitous in the code and docs.
  
  - ledger 3 has Transactions containing Postings.
  

  - hledger 0.5 has LedgerTransactions containing Postings, plus
    Transactions as before (a Posting plus it's parent's info).  The
    \"transaction\" term is pretty ingrained in the code, docs and with
    users, so we've kept it.
