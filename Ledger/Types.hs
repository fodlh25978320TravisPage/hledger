This is the next layer up from Ledger.Utils. All main data types are
defined here to avoid import cycles; see the corresponding modules for
documentation.

On the current use of terminology:

- ledger 2 has Entrys containing Transactions.

- hledger 0.4 has Entrys containing RawTransactions, and Transactions
  which are a RawTransaction with its parent Entry's info added.
  Transactions are what we most work with when reporting and are
  ubiquitous in the code and docs.

- ledger 3 has Transactions containing Postings.

- hledger 0.5 has LedgerTransactions containing Postings, with
  Transactions kept just as in hledger 0.4 (a Posting with it's parent's
  info added). They could be named PartialTransactions or
  TransactionPostings, but that just gets too verbose and obscure for devs
  and users.
