An 'Amount' is some quantity of money, shares, or anything else.

A simple amount is a 'Commodity', quantity pair:

@
  $1 
  Â£-50
  EUR 3.44 
  GOOG 500
  1.5h
  90 apples
  0 
@

An amount may also have a per-unit price, or conversion rate, in terms
of some other commodity. If present, this is displayed after \@:

@
  EUR 3 \@ $1.35
@

A 'MixedAmount' is zero or more simple amounts.  Mixed amounts are
usually normalised so that there is no more than one amount in each
commodity, and no zero amounts (or, there is just a single zero amount
and no others.):

@
  $50 + EUR 3
  16h + $13.55 + AAPL 500 + 6 oranges
  0
@

We can do limited arithmetic with simple or mixed amounts: either
price-preserving arithmetic with similarly-priced amounts, or
price-discarding arithmetic which ignores and discards prices.
