{-|
An 'Amount' is some quantity of money, shares, or anything else.

A simple amount is a 'Commodity', quantity pair:

@
  $1 
  Â£-50
  EUR 3.44 
  GOOG 500
  1.5h
  90apples
  0 
@

A 'MixedAmount' is zero or more simple amounts:

@
  $50, EUR 3, AAPL 500
  16h, $13.55, oranges 6
@

Not implemented:
Commodities may be convertible or not. A mixed amount containing only
convertible commodities can be converted to a simple amount. Arithmetic
examples:

@
  $1 - $5 = $-4
  $1 + EUR 0.76 = $2
  EUR0.76 + $1 = EUR 1.52
  EUR0.76 - $1 = 0
  ($5, 2h) + $1 = ($6, 2h)
  ($50, EUR 3, AAPL 500) + ($13.55, oranges 6) = $67.51, AAPL 500, oranges 6
  ($50, EUR 3) * $-1 = $-53.96
  ($50, AAPL 500) * $-1 = error
