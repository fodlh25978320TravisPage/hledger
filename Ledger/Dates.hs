For date and time values, we use the standard Day and UTCTime types.

A 'SmartDate' is a date which may be partially-specified or relative.
Eg 2008/12/31, but also 2008/12, 12/31, tomorrow, last week, next year.
We represent these as a triple of strings like ("2008","12",""),
("","","tomorrow"), ("","last","week").

A 'DateSpan' is the span of time between two specific calendar dates, or
possibly an open-ended span where one or both dates are missing. We use
this term since "period" and "interval" are ambiguous.

{-| 
Parse a date in any of the formats allowed in ledger's period expressions,
and maybe some others:

> 2004
> 2004/10
> 2004/10/1
> 10/1
> 21
> october, oct
> yesterday, today, tomorrow
> (not yet) this/next/last week/day/month/quarter/year

Returns a SmartDate, to be converted to a full date later (see fixSmartDate).
Assumes any text in the parse stream has been lowercased.
