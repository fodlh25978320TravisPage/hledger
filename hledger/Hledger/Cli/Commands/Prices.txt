prices

Print the market prices declared with P directives. With
--infer-market-prices, also show any additional prices inferred from
costs. With --show-reverse, also show additional prices inferred by
reversing known prices.

Price amounts are always displayed with their full precision, except for
reverse prices which are limited to 8 decimal digits.

Prices can be filtered by a date:, cur: or amt: query.

Generally if you run this command with --infer-market-prices
--show-reverse, it will show the same prices used internally to
calculate value reports. But if in doubt, you can inspect those directly
by running the value report with --debug=2.
