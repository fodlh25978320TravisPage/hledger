cashflow, cf
This command displays a cashflow statement, showing the inflows and
outflows affecting "cash" (ie, liquid) assets. Amounts are shown with
normal positive sign, as in conventional financial statements.

_FLAGS

The "cash" accounts shown are those accounts declared with the Cash
type, or otherwise all accounts under a top-level asset account (case
insensitive, plural allowed) which do not have fixed, investment,
receivable or A/R in their name.

(This report is essentially similar to "hledger balance --change assets
not:fixed not:investment not:receivable".)

Example:

$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement

Cash flows:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Total:
--------------------
                 $-1

With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
report period. Normally cashflow shows changes in assets per period,
though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the report mode
with --change/--cumulative/--historical. Instead of absolute values
percentages can be displayed with -%.

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, html, and
(experimental) json.
