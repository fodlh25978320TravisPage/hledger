demo

Play demos of hledger usage in the terminal, if asciinema is installed.

_FLAGS

Run this command with no argument to list the demos. To play a demo,
write its number or a prefix or substring of its title. Tips:

Make your terminal window large enough to see the demo clearly.

During playback, several keys are available: SPACE to pause/unpause, .
to step forward (while paused), CTRL-c quit.

asciinema options can be added following a double dash, such as -s N to
adjust speed and -i SECS to limit pauses. Run asciinema -h to list these
options.

Examples:

$ hledger demo                      # list available demos
$ hledger demo 1                    # play the first demo
$ hledger demo install -- -s5 -i.5  # play the install demo at 5x speed,
                                    # with pauses limited to half a second
