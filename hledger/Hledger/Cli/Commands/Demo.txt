demo

Play small demos of hledger usage in the terminal.

_FLAGS

Run this command with no argument to list the demos. To play a demo,
write its number or a prefix or substring of its title. asciinema must
be installed.

During playback, several keys are available: - SPACE pause/unpause - .
step forward (while paused) - CTRL-c quit early

asciinema options can be added following a double dash, such as -s
(adjust speed) and -i (limit idle time). Run asciinema -h to list them.

Examples:

$ hledger demo                   # list available demos
$ hledger demo 1                 # play the first demo
$ hledger demo install -s5 -i.5  # play the demo named or containing "install",
                                 # at 5x speed, limiting idle time to 0.5s.
