hledger's built-in commands.

Each command has a similarly-named module, Somecommand.hs.

Each command's help is kept in Somecommand.md. 
This file is included by Somecommand.hs to help build the command's --help output,
and by hledger/hledger_commands.m4.md to help build the hledger manual.
It has some special features:

- The first line should specify the command name and any aliases,
  as space or comma-separated words.

- A line containing just _FLAGS_ will be replaced in --help output by
  the command's flags list. If there's no such line, the flags will be
  displayed at the end. In the manual, no flags list is shown.

- Markdown can be used to influence the appearance of the manuals,
  especially the html version. But the markup will also appear
  uninterpreted in the --help output, so use sparingly.

- GHC (and ghcid etc.) won't notice changes in this file;
  you have to also touch the .hs file.
