With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
report period. Normally incomestatement shows revenues/expenses per
period, though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the
report mode with --change/--cumulative/--historical. Instead of absolute
values percentages can be displayed with -%.

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, html, and
(experimental) json.
