(unreleased)

Journal format:
- A # (hash) in column 0 is now also supported for starting a top-level journal comment, like Ledger.
- The "too many missing amounts" error now reminds about the 2-space rule.
- Fix: . (period) is no longer parsed as a valid amount.
- Fix: default commodity directives no longer limit the maximum display precision (#169).

CLI:
- Commands list cleanups; descriptions are shown for known hledger-* add-ons.
- If both source and compiled version of a haskell add-on are found, only the latter is shown.
- Fix: add-ons with digits in the name are now found.
- Fix: add-on arguments containing a single quote now work.

Queries:
- The currency/commodity query prefix (sym:) has been renamed to cur:.
- Currency/commodity queries are applied more strongly in register and
  balance reports, filtering out unwanted currencies entirely. Eg
  hledger balance cur:'\$' now reports only the dollar amounts even if
  there are multi-currency transactions or postings.
- Amount queries (like amt:N) now ignore sign by default. To do a signed comparison,
  write N with its sign (eg amt:+N, amt:=-N, amt:<+N, amt:>-N).
- Fix: amount queries no longer give false positives on multi-commodity amounts.

accounts:
- An accounts command has been added, similar to Ledger's, for listing account names.

add:
- Tab completion now works at all prompts, and will insert the default if there's no input.
- Account and amount defaults are more robust and useful.
- The enter key can also be used to end transactions, if there are no more default postings.
- Input prompts are displayed in green, when supported.

balance:
- Balance reports in flat mode now always show exclusive (subaccount-excluding) balances.
- Balance reports in flat mode with --depth now aggregate deeper accounts at the depth limit instead of excluding them.
- Multicolumn reports in flat mode now support --drop.
- Multicolumn balance reports can now show the account hierarchy with --tree.
- Multicolumn reports now use all data in the displayed periods
- Fix: zero-balance leaf accounts below a non-zero-balance parent are no longer always shown (#170).
- Fix: multicolumn reports now support --date2 (cf #174)

balancesheet, cashflow, incomestatement:
- These commands now support --flat and --drop.

print:
- Tag queries (tag:) will now match a transaction if any of its postings match.

register:
- Fix: --date2 now works with report intervals (fixes #174)

Miscellaneous:
- Compatible with GHC 7.8, text 1.1
- Compatible with GHC 7.2 (#155)
- Debug output improvements.
- extra/hledger-rewrite.hs, adds postings to matched entries.
