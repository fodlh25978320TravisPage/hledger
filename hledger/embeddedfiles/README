These files are embedded into the hledger executable at compile time.
They include:

- symbolic links to all the main hledger manuals in several formats, for embedding in Hledger/Cli/DocFiles.hs.
  (Having these symlinked here within the hledger package allows embedding them without using absolute paths.)

- asciinema screen casts, for embedding in Hledger/Cli/Commands/Demo.hs.
