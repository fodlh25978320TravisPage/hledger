These files are embedded into the hledger executable at compile time.
They include:

- symbolic links to all the main hledger manuals in several formats, for embedding in Hledger/Cli/DocFiles.hs.
  (Having the hledger-ui/hledger-web files also symlinked here within the hledger package allows embedding them without using absolute paths.)

- symbolic links to all the hledger tldr pages.

- asciinema screen casts, for embedding in Hledger/Cli/Commands/Demo.hs.
