# COMMANDS

hledger provides a number of subcommands; `hledger` with no arguments
shows a list.

If you install additional `hledger-*` packages, or if you put programs
or scripts named `hledger-NAME` in your PATH, these will also be
listed as subcommands.

Run a subcommand by writing its name as first argument (eg `hledger
incomestatement`). You can also write one of the standard short aliases
displayed in parentheses in the command list (`hledger b`), or any
any unambiguous prefix of a command name (`hledger inc`). 

Here are all the builtin commands in alphabetical order.
See also `hledger` for a more organised command list,
and `hledger CMD -h` for detailed command help.
