Thanks for your suggestion! Some tips:

- Have you looked for related features in the hledger manuals ? Eg:
  https://hledger.org/dev/hledger.html

- We try to not clutter the bug tracker with too many wishes, since ideas are endless and developers are few.
  Often it's better to discuss and build interest on chat or the mail list first:
  https://hledger.org/support.html

- Consider adding:
  - A draft of command line help
  - A draft of user manual content and suggested location
  - A small mockup or example of intended output or UI.
