Thanks for your suggestion! Here are some tips (please delete them before submitting):

- Have you looked for related features in the hledger manuals ? Eg:
  https://hledger.org/dev/hledger.html

- We try to not clutter the bug tracker with too many wishes, since ideas are endless and developers are few.
  Often it's better to discuss and build interest on chat or the mail list first:
  https://hledger.org/support.html

- Not required, but any of these help to move things forward:
  - A draft of user manual content and suggested location.
  - A draft of command line help.
  - A small mockup or example of intended output or UI.
  - Appropriate topic labels, if you have the access level to set those.
    (If not, feel free to write them in the issue title, eg as a prefix.)
