Thank you!

Note, we would prefer not to clutter the bug tracker with wishlist items and ideas.
Often it's best to raise them on the [mail list, IRC chat room or reddit](http://hledger.org#help) first,
to discuss solutions and attract interest.
Use your best judgement.

Requests for help and support with hledger are very welcome but also best handled
on the [hledger mail list](http://list.hledger.org) 
or [#hledger IRC chat room](http://irc.hledger.org),
not this issue tracker.
