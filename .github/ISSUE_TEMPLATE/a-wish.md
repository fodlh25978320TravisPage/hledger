Thank you for your input!

Note, we try to not clutter the bug tracker with wishlist items and ideas.
Often it's best to raise these first
on the [#hledger IRC chat room](http://irc.hledger.org) (quickest; no chat client needed)
or the [hledger mail list](http://list.hledger.org),
to discuss solutions and attract interest.
Use your best judgement.
