Some things to check before requesting:

- We try to not clutter the bug tracker with too many wishlist items.
  Often it's best to discuss and attract interest on chat or the mail list first;
  use your best judgement. https://hledger.org#help-feedback

- Have you looked for a related feature in (the right version of) the manual ? 
  Use `hledger help [--help]` to view the built-in manuals,
  or view the hledger.org -> REFERENCE MANUALS and choose the proper version
  at the top of the page.
