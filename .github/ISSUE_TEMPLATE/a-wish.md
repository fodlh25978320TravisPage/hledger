Thanks for contributing. But first:

- Have you looked for related features in the hledger manual (latest version) ?
  https://hledger.org/hledger.html
  https://hledger.org/hledger-ui.html
  https://hledger.org/hledger-web.html

- Ideas are endless and developers are few, so we try to not clutter the bug tracker with wishes.
  Often it's best to discuss them on chat/mail list/forum first:
  https://hledger.org/support

- Concrete proposals with draft docs move forward more quickly. Consider adding:
  - A draft of user manual changes
  - A draft of command line help
  - A mockup of intended output or UI
