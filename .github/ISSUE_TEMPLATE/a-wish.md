Thank you for helping to make hledger better!

We try to not clutter the bug tracker with too many wishlist items.
Often it's best to discuss and attract interest on chat or the mail list first;
use your best judgement.

Things to check before requesting:

- Have you looked for the feature in (the right version of) the manual ? 
  Use `hledger help [--help]` to view the built-in manuals,
  or view the hledger.org -> REFERENCE MANUALS and choose the proper version at the top of the page.
