Thanks for reporting! Here are some tips (please remove this text before submitting):

- Have you checked (the right version of) the manual ? Eg https://hledger.org/hledger.html
- If some discussion would help, just ask in chat or mail list: https://hledger.org/support.html
- Any of these are very helpful: a small reproducible example, hledger --version output,
  what platform you're running on, a link to to any relevant doc that you found.
