Thanks for your issue report! 
Note, questions about how to use hledger are usually best asked in the chat room or mail list.
It's ok to ask here if you're not sure or those don't work for you (let us know why):

Type  | Address | Tips
:-----|:--------|:----------
Chat room (Freenode IRC) | http://irc.hledger.org or <span style="white-space:nowrap;">https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#hledger:matrix.org</span> | Usually the quickest way to get help. Answers can take a few seconds to a few hours. Login not required. 
Email list (Google group)               | http://list.hledger.org or hledger@googlegroups.com | The largest and most permanent help/discussion area. List subscription not required (I think). Non-subscriber posts will be delayed until approved. 
Private email                           | simon@joyful.com | For sensitive issues, eg security-related.
