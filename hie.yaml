# Make HLS use the stack yaml file mentioned below.
# This works better than relying on the implicit cradle, which doesn't
# work with multi-package projects (opening a file from a second package breaks HLS).

# The stack.yaml below currently uses GHC 9.4.4 which is supported by eg HLS 1.9.1.0.
# If you need to run with a different version of HLS or different GHC, try using the
# appropriate stackX.Y.yaml. ghcup tui shows the GHC versions supported by your
# currently selected HLS.

    # since there is a hie.yaml, these must be listed explicitly 
    # (a current limitation of hls with a multi-package stack project):
