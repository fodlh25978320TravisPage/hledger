hledger
=======

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other
commodities, using standard accounting principles. It is quite limited in
features, but reliable.  For some, it is a bare-bones, less complex, less
expensive alternative to Quicken or Microsoft Money.

hledger aims to help both computer experts and every-day users gain clarity in their finances and time management.
I use it every day to: 

- track spending and income
- see time reports by day/week/month/project
- get accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
- track invoices

Here is a demo_ of the web interface.

Here are ready-to-run binaries_ for mac, windows and gnu/linux.
They are not the `current release`_, sorry about that.

Here is the manual_.
For support and more technical info, see `development`_ or `email me`_.
