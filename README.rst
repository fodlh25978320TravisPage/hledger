=======

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other
commodities, using standard accounting principles. It is quite limited in
features, but reliable.  For some, it is a bare-bones, less complex, less
expensive alternative to Quicken or Microsoft Money.
hledger is available for free under the GNU General Public License.

hledger aims to help both computer experts and every-day users gain clarity in their finances and time management.
I use it every day to: 

- track spending and income
- see time reports by day/week/month/project
- get accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
- track invoices

The manual_ and screenshots_ will explain more. There's also a demo_ of hledger's web interface.
To get started tracking your own numbers, download_ a copy.

For support and more technical info, see `development`_ or `email me`_.
I appreciate feedback on all aspects of hledger. Thanks!
