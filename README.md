# hledger

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or
other commodities, using standard accounting principles. It is
quite limited in features, but reliable. For some, it is a
bare-bones, less complex, less expensive alternative to Quicken or
Microsoft Money. hledger is available for free under the GNU
General Public License.

hledger aims to help both computer experts and every-day users gain
clarity in their finances and time management. I use it every day
to:

-   track spending and income
-   see time reports by day/week/month/project
-   get accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
-   track invoices

The [manual](MANUAL.html) and [screenshots](SCREENSHOTS.html) will
explain more. There's also a [demo](http://demo.hledger.org) of
hledger's web interface. To get started tracking your own numbers,
[download](DOWNLOAD.html) a copy.

For support and more technical info, see
[development](DEVELOPMENT.html) or
[email me](mailto:simon@joyful.com?subject=hledger:). I appreciate
feedback on all aspects of hledger. Thanks!
