# hledger

## command-line and web accounting tools

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other
commodities, inspired by and compatible with [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org). It is quite
limited in features, but lightweight and reliable. For some, it is a
bare-bones, simpler, less expensive alternative to Quicken or GnuCash.  It
is available for free under the GNU General Public License.

hledger aims to help both computer experts and regular folks gain clarity
in their finances and time management, but currently it is a little more
suited to techies. I use it every day to:

-   track spending and income
-   see time reports by day/week/month/project
-   get accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
-   track invoices

hledger is first a command-line tool, but also provides a web
interface (try the [hledger-web demo](http://demo.hledger.org)). Read
the [documentation](DOCS.html) to learn more, including
[how we are different from ledger](FAQ.html#how-does-hledger-relate-to-ledger),
and get started tracking your numbers!
