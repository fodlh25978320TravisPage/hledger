API-ish changes in hledger-lib.
For user-visible changes, see hledger's change log.

0.27 (2015/10/30)

- The main hledger types now derive NFData, which makes it easier to
  time things with criterion.

- Utils has been split up more.

- Utils.Regex: regular expression compilation has been memoized, and
  memoizing versions of regexReplace[CI] have been added, since
  compiling regular expressions every time seems to be quite
  expensive (#244).
 
- Utils.String: strWidth is now aware of multi-line strings (#242).

- Read: parsers now use a consistent p suffix.

- New dependencies: deepseq, uglymemo.

- All the hledger packages' cabal files are now generated from
  simpler, less redundant yaml files by hpack, in principle. In
  practice, manual fixups are still needed until hpack gets better,
  but it's still a win.
