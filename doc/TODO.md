# TODO

Some bite-sized tasks awaiting volunteers. These are:
currently needed, <!-- described in one line,  -->
and estimated as Small (~1 hour), Medium (~0.5 day) or Large (1 day)
("for someone reasonably suited to this task". Estimates can be wrong.).
If you'd like to help, this is a good place to make a quick impact.
