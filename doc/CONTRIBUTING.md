New contributors are always welcome in the hledger project. 
Jump in! Or [ask us](support.html) to help you find a task.

### Funder

### Tester

- Test installation on platforms you have access to
- Test examples, advice, and links in the docs
- Run the latest release or developer build in daily use
- Run [tests](#run-package-tests)
- Run [benchmarks](#run-package-benchmarks)
- Report packaging, documentation, UX, functional, performance issues
- Report and help analyse problems via irc/mail list/bug tracker

When reporting bugs, don't forget to search the tracker for a similar bug report.
Otherwise, open a new bug by clicking "New issue", or <http://bugs.hledger.org/new>.

Enhancement requests are sometimes added to the tracker,but for these consider using
the IRC channel and mail list (see [Getting help](index.html#getting-help)).
Both are archived and linkable, so the idea won't be lost.
There is also a collection of wishes at the old [trello board](http://trello.hledger.org).
