A regression is "something that used to work, that broke", or "an unintended not-good change"
in a released version of hledger.

We don't like regressions. We want to detect them quickly, repair them quickly, and reduce their frequency.

## Regression bounty

You can help!
We offer a standard bounty ($100 USD) for each new regression reported in hledger releases.
([original discussion](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1570)).
To claim the bounty:

1. Discover a new regression yourself (and don't be the one who caused it, generally)
2. Report it in the [hledger bug tracker](http://bugs.hledger.org)
3. Wait for the issues manager (currently [SM](https://joyful.com)) to confirm by applying the REGRESSION label
4. Submit an expense to <https://opencollective.com/hledger>
   - "Submit Expense" (if you are logged in, it moves under the ACTIONS menu) 
   - Type: Invoice
   - Expense title: Regression bounty for #NNNN
   - Description:   Regression bounty for #NNNN
   - Amount: $100
5. Also announce that you've done this, on the issue page or in chat (to help ensure it is not overlooked)
6. Wait for the issue manager to approve it. This should not take more than a day or two.
7. After approval, wait for Open Collective to pay it. Payouts happen twice a week.
