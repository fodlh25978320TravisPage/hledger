## Regression bounty

(Shortcut url: https://hledger.org/regressions)

We offer a standard bounty ($100 USD) for each new regression reported in hledger releases.
([discussion](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1570)).

A regression is "something that used to work, that broke", or "an
unintended not-good change" in a released version of hledger.
Here are the [past regressions](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues?q=label%3Aregression%21+label%3Arelease-needed).

To claim the regression bounty:

1. Discover a new regression yourself (and don't be the one who caused it, generally)
3. Report it in the [hledger bug tracker](http://bugs.hledger.org)
4. Wait for the issues manager (currently [SM](https://joyful.com)) to confirm with the REGRESSION label.
5. Submit an expense to https://opencollective.com/hledger
   1. Submit Expense (if you are logged in, it moves under the ACTIONS menu) 
   2. Type: Invoice
   3. Expense title: Regression bounty for #NNNN
   4. Description: Regression bounty for ISSUEURL per https://hledger.org/regressionbounty
   5. Amount: $100
6. Also announce that you've done this on the issue page (to help ensure it is not overlooked)
7. Wait for issue manager to approve it. This should not take more than a day or two.
8. After approval, wait for Open Collective to pay it. Payouts happen twice a week.
