[tldr](https://tldr.sh) provides minimal, example-focussed doc pages for command line tools and their subcommands.
It is an excellent project and its contraints and practical focus are a good remedy for endless PTA docs.

tldr pages are short but worth polishing; they represent a fair bit of effort.
These are links to all hledger-related pages currently in the `tldr` project.
These are crafted first to suit tldr and its reviewers,
but we should try to reuse them elsewhere, eg in command docs,
if possible without too much divergence/duplication.
