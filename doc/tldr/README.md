[tldr-pages](https://tldr.sh) provides minimal, example-focussed doc pages for command line tools and their subcommands.

tldr pages are short but high value, and a great counterbalance to PTA's verbose docs.
So they are worth prioritising and maintaining.
gutjuri made the first hledger tldr page in 2022, and sm added more in 2024.

This directory has convenient symlinks for accessing the hledger-related tldr pages
(if tldr is cloned as a sibling to the hledger project directory).

The tldr pages are crafted first to suit tldr and its reviewers,
but we should try to reuse them elsewhere when there is not too much divergence/duplication.

If you speak a language other than english, you could contribute translations!
It is relatively easy:

Here are [all hledger-related tldr pages](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Atldr-pages%2Ftldr%20hledger&type=code),
and here is where to check their [translation status](https://lukwebsforge.github.io/tldri18n).
