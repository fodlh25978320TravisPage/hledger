Attention, attention hledger-folk! Once again, Happy Hallowe'en. After
almost 10 years of steady development, I am very pleased to announce:

About the project: hledger is a cross-platform program for tracking
money, time, or any other commodity using double-entry accounting and
a simple plain text file format. Inspired by Ledger CLI, hledger
provides command-line, curses and web interfaces, and aims to be a
reliable, practical tool for daily use.

Contributors to this release, one year in the making, include: 
Simon Michael, Dominik Süß, Thomas R. Koll, Moritz Kiefer,
jungle-boogie, Sergei Trofimovich, Malte Brandy, Sam Doshi, 
Mitchell Rosen, Hans-Peter Deifel, Brian Scott, and Andrew Jones.

Notable changes since 0.27:

- the hledger.org website is simpler, clearer, and more
  mobile-friendly

- docs have been reorganized, with more focussed manuals available in
  multiple versions, formats and as built-in help

- we support the latest GHC (8 and 7.10), stackage snapshots, and
  libs.  (GHC 7.8 and 7.6 support are not currently supported,
  maintainers welcome.)

- hledger has migrated from parsec to megaparsec and from String to
  Text, parsers have been simplified, memory usage is ~30% less on
  large files, speed is slightly improved all around

- --pivot (group by arbitrary tag instead of account) and --anon
  (obfuscate account names) are now supported

- hledger-ui has acquired many new features making it more useful
  (file editing, filtering, historical/period modes, quick period
  browsing..)

- hledger-web is more robust and more mobile-friendly

- hledger-api, a simple web API server, has been added

- a new "timedot" file format allows retroactive/approximate time
  logging

- the project continues to grow. A call for help was sent out last
  month, and contributor activity is increasing

- the website http://plaintextaccounting.org was created as a portal
  and knowledge base for hledger, Ledger, beancount and related tools
  and practices.
