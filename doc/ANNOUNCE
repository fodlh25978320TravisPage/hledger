hledger is a robust, cross-platform "plain text accounting" tool, for
tracking money, time, stocks, cryptocurrencies or any other commodity,
using double-entry accounting, private or shared plain text files,
revision control, and command-line, curses or web UIs.

I'm pleased to announce the on-schedule release of hledger 1.12.
Thanks to release contributors: A, B.

Full release notes are at http://hledger.org/release-notes.html#hledger-1.12


Install
-------

All install methods are described at http://hledger.org/download .
You can download windows binaries, or use a package manager, though in
some cases these will install an older hledger version.  

You can build the latest hledger packages with stack:

$ stack install --resolver=lts-12 cassava-megaparsec-1.0.0 hledger-lib-1.11 
  hledger-1.11 [hledger-ui-1.11] [hledger-web-1.11] [hledger-api-1.11]

or with cabal:

$ cabal update && cabal install hledger-1.11 [hledger-ui-1.11] 
  [hledger-web-1.11] [hledger-api-1.11]

If you don't have stack or cabal, or if you are having trouble,
on systems with bash installed (mac, linux, unix-like windows..)
hledger-install.sh is an easy and reliable way to get the latest hledger:

$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonmichael/hledger/master/hledger-install/hledger-install.sh > hledger-install.sh
$ less hledger-install.sh  # satisfy yourself that the script is safe
$ bash hledger-install.sh


Getting started
---------------

$ hledger add           # record some transactions, with guidance
$ hledger print         # show recorded transactions
$ hledger balance       # show totals by account
$ hledger -h            # show quick help
$ hledger               # list available commands
$ hledger help          # list built-in manuals

To get oriented, see the tutorials and manuals at http://hledger.org .
To get help, say hello and ask questions in the #hledger IRC channel
on Freenode, accessible at http://irc.hledger.org .
New users and all forms of help are always welcome!


Best,
