I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.40, with a new config file system,
sortable register output, FODS output, and prettier tables.

hledger is free, robust, friendly, multicurrency, double-entry,
plain text accounting software for unix, mac, windows, and the web.
Written in Haskell for reliability and longevity,
it is built around human-readable, version-controllable plain text files,
inspired by and largely compatible with Ledger CLI,
and convertible to and from Beancount.

Newcomers, experts, contributors, sponsors, feedback are welcome!
