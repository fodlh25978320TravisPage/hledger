I'm pleased to announce hledger 0.27!

hledger is a cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable
file format.  It can also read CSV or timelog files, and export CSV.
It provides command-line, curses and web interfaces, and aims to be a
reliable, practical tool for daily use.  It is inspired by and largely
compatible with ledger(1).

This release introduces hledger-ui, a new curses-style interface that
I'm quite pleased with (not yet available on Windows). Built on vty
and the new brick library, it lets you review account balances and
transactions with fewer keystrokes and less effort.

Also, we can now report current value based on market prices (hurrah);
wide characters are displayed properly; regular expression account
aliases are fast; and unix man pages are provided. You can see all
changes at http://hledger.org/release-notes#hledger-0.27 .

Release contributors: 
Simon Michael,
Carlos Lopez-Camey.

hledger can be installed with cabal or stack; see
http://hledger.org/download .
If you'd like to contribute Windows or Mac binaries, please get in
touch.

Happy Hallowe'en!
-Simon
