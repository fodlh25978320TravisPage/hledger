I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.30 ! Highlights:

- Boolean queries - with the new `expr:` query type you can freely
  combine other queries with AND, OR, NOT and parentheses.

- Easier CSV file management - you can now read a CSV .rules file, and let it
  fetch the data file from a downloads directory, simplifying CSV file management.

- Built-in demos - a new `demo` command plays several asciinema casts
  to demonstrate features. We'll add more of these in future.

- hledger-ui has a new Cash accounts screen, and now starts on the Menu screen.

- The usual miscellaneous fixes.

Thank you release contributors Chris Lemaire and Yehoshua Pesach Wallach.
