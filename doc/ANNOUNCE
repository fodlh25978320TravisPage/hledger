Full release notes are at http://hledger.org/release-notes#hledger-1.3
The next major release is scheduled for September 30.

hledger (http://hledger.org) is a dependable, precise, cross-platform
program for tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using
double-entry accounting and a simple plain text file format.  It is a
haskell reimplementation of Ledger, provides command-line, curses and
web interfaces, and aims to be a robust, practical tool for daily use.

To get started, install the stack tool, eg by downloading from
http://haskell-lang.org/get-started. Then install hledger (and
optionally the alternate UIs):

$ stack install hledger-lib-1.3 hledger-1.3 [hledger-ui-1.3] [hledger-web-1.3] [hledger-api-1.3]

(cabal experts can use that instead. See http://hledger.org/download
for more install options.)

Ensure $HOME/.local/bin is in your $PATH, and try some commands:

$ hledger               # list commands
$ hledger -h            # quick help
$ hledger --man         # man page for the hledger CLI tool
$ hledger info journal  # info manual for the journal format

etc.

Our IRC channel is #hledger on Freenode, and you can find out more at
