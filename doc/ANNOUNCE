About:

hledger (http://hledger.org) is a command-line tool and haskell
library for tracking financial transactions, which are stored in a
human-readable plain text format. It can also read CSV or timelog
files, and output CSV. It provides useful reports, and can also help
you record new transactions interactively.  Add-on commands include
hledger-web (a web interface), hledger-irr (for calculating internal
rate of return) and hledger-interest (for generating interest
transactions).  hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with
Ledger, and can be used with some Ledger files.

Installation:

$ cabal update; [cabal sandbox init;] cabal install hledger[-web]

or:

$ git clone https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger.git
$ cd hledger
$ git checkout hledger-0.26
$ stack install

or see http://hledger.org/download for more options.

Best!
-Simon
