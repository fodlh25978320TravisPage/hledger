hledger (http://hledger.org) is a dependable, precise, cross-platform
program for tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using
double-entry accounting and a simple plain text file format.  It is a
haskell reimplementation of Ledger, provides command-line, curses and
web interfaces, and aims to be a robust, practical tool for daily use.

Get stack, eg from http://haskell-lang.org/get-started
$ stack install --resolver=nightly hledger [hledger-ui] [hledger-web] [hledger-api]
