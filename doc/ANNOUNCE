Two months since last release, I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.1 !
Thank you to contributors Johannes Gerer, Nikolay Orlyuk, and Shubham
Lagwankar, along with all others who contributed in other ways.

hledger (http://hledger.org) is a dependable, precise, cross-platform
program for tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using
double-entry accounting and a simple plain text file format.  Inspired
by the Ledger project, hledger provides command-line, curses and web
interfaces, and aims to be a robust, practical tool for daily use.

Notable user-visible changes in this release:

- hledger-ui --watch live-updates as files or the current date change,
  useful eg when reconciling or for a time log dashboard

- Ledger-style balance assignments are now supported in journal files

$ stack install --resolver=nightly hledger [hledger-ui] [hledger-web] [hledger-api]
