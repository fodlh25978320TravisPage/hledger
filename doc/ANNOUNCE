I'm very pleased to announce hledger 1.32, including work from contributors
Jonathan Dowland, S. Zeid, Charlie Ambrose, Jacob Weisz, Peter Sagerson, 
Philipp Klocke, Stephen Morgan, and bobobo1618.

Highlights: 
More precision control, beancount output, TSV output, --summary-only,
strict/idempotent import, CSV rule enhancements, timedot letters, fixes -
it's a lot. Set aside some time to read the notes.
