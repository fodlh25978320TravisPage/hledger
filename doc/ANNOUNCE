I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.28 !

https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/1.28
https://hledger.org/install
https://hledger.org/release-notes.html#hledger-1-28

Nothing earth-shaking for users in this release, but internal changes
and the usual incremental improvements.
Highlights:
new hledger-ui screens and default screen;
new hledger-move, watchaccounts scripts.

Thank you to release contributors
Felix Yan,
Patrick Fiaux.

What is hledger ?

- Fast, reliable, free, multicurrency, double-entry, plain text
  accounting[1] software that runs on unix, mac, windows, and the web

- Built around human-readable, version-controllable plain text files

- Inspired by and largely compatible with Ledger CLI[2];
  convertible to and from Beancount[3]

- Written in Haskell for correctness and longevity.
