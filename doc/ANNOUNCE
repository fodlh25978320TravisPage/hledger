I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.16.1 !

hledger 1.16 was released on schedule on 2019-12-01, but only to
hackage and github, since I was travelling and behind a rain-disrupted
microwave link. Today brings the release notes & docs updates on
hledger.org, and a 1.16.1 point release with some packaging updates.

Thanks to release contributors Dmitry Astapov, Mykola Orliuk, Brian
Wignall, Alejandro Garc√≠a Montoro, Timofey ZAKREVSKIY, Amitai
Burstein, and Michael Kainer.
