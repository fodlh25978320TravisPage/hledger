I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.31 ! Highlights:

- In conversion transactions, costs and equity postings are matched
  more tolerantly.

- The `print` command now more closely replicates the original journal
   amount styles, which is helpful when round-tripping / cleaning up
   journal files.

- Multi-pivot - the --pivot option can now construct account names
  from multiple fields.

Thank you release contributors Dmitry Astapov, Eric Mertens,
Jay Neubrand, and Jonathan Dowland.
