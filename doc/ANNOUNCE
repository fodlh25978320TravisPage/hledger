I'm pleased to announce hledger and hledger-web 0.25.

This release brings GHC 7.10 compatibility, terminal width awareness,
useful averages and totals columns, and a more robust hledger-web add
form.

Full release notes: http://hledger.org/release-notes#hledger-0.25 .
Release contributors: Simon Michael, Julien Moutinho.

hledger (http://hledger.org) is a command-line tool and haskell
library for tracking financial transactions, which are stored in a
human-readable plain text format. It can also read CSV or timelog
files, and output CSV. It provides useful reports, and can also help
you record new transactions interactively.  Add-on commands include
hledger-web (a web interface), hledger-irr (for calculating internal
rate of return) and hledger-interest (for generating interest
transactions).  hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with
Ledger, and can be used with some Ledger files.

Installation:

cabal update; cabal install hledger [hledger-web]
or see http://hledger.org/download
and http://hledger.org/installing for more options.

Best!
-Simon
