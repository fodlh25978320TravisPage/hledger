What is hledger ?

- Fast, reliable, free, multicurrency, double-entry, plain text
  accounting[1] software that runs on unix, mac, windows, and the web

- Built around human-readable, version-controllable plain text files

- Inspired by and largely compatible with Ledger CLI[2];
  convertible to and from Beancount[3]

- Written in Haskell for correctness and longevity.
