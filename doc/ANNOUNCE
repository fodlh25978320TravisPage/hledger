hledger (https://hledger.org) is a dependable, cross-platform "plain
text accounting" tool, with command-line, terminal and web interfaces.
It is an actively maintained, largely compatible reimplementation of
Ledger CLI with many improvements. You can use it to track money,
time, investments, cryptocurrencies, inventory and more. See also the
Plain Text Accounting site (https://plaintextaccounting.org).
