# hledger is...

### a lightweight, dependable, cross-platform accounting program

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or
other commodities, on unix, mac and windows. With simple yet powerful
functionality accessed from command line or web browser, it is a
reliable, flexible, future-proof alternative to Quicken or GnuCash. I
use it for:

- tracking spending and income
- seeing time reports by day/week/month/project
- getting accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
- tracking invoices
- building financial and time clarity and serenity

### Free software

hledger is available under the GNU GPLv3+, which helps ensure that it
will remain free and available for as long as you need it.  It has
been developed as a community project by
[Simon Michael](http://joyful.com) and
[contributors](contributors.html) since 2007.

<div style="margin:0 10em 0 10em;">
### inspired by Ledger

hledger was inspired by and maintains substantial compatibility with [Ledger](faq.html#hledger-and-ledger),
and is part of the enthusiastic and supportive "*ledger" community.

### a command-line tool, that preserves your data

hledger is first a command-line tool. It follows Ledger's philosophy:
your data lives in a simple, safe, plain text file which you can edit
any way you wish; hledger reads that file and produces reports of
various kinds, without changing your data. (It can help you add new
transactions, but does not change existing ones.)
</div>

<div style="margin:0 10em 0 5em;">
### ...with a web UI

hledger comes with a built-in web server providing an alternate
[browser-based interface](manual.html#web), for assisted data entry
and point and click reporting. The web and command-line clients can be
used simultaneously.

<div style="margin:0 5em 0 10em;">
### a Haskell application and library

hledger is written in Haskell, a modern and highly-regarded
programming language which contributes to hledger's robustness,
performance and long-term maintainability.  Most functionality is
exposed as reusable Haskell
[libraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger-lib), making it
easy to write your own hledger-compatible
[scripts](more-docs.html#scripting-examples), [add-ons](manual.html#add-ons) and
applications.
</div>

<div style="margin:0 20em 0 0em;">
### documented

Complete, accurate documentation is always a top priority.
</div>

<div style="margin:0 15em 0 5em;">
### comfortable for techies, usable by all

hledger aims to be useful to both computer experts and regular folks.
Currently it is a bit more suited to power users, who appreciate the
power of text files, revision control, scriptability and double entry
accounting. The web interface helps make it accessible to GUI-only
folk as well.
</div>

<div style="margin:0 10em 0 10em;">
### focussed on serving the user

hledger strives to be accessible, practical and to provide real-world value.
I've been depending on and improving it continuously since 2007.
I needed a tool like this badly, and I want to keep it growing and helping others who can also benefit.
(You can help!)
