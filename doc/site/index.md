#  hledger

## lightweight, portable, dependable accounting tools

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other commodities,
on unix, mac and windows.

It is first a command-line tool, but there is also a [web interface](manual.html#web)
and a [Haskell library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger-lib) for
building your own programs and [scripts](more-docs.html#scripting-examples)
(hledger is written in Haskell).
hledger was inspired by and is largely compatible with [Ledger](faq.html#hledger-and-ledger).
hledger is free software available under the GNU General Public License v3+.

hledger aims to help both computer experts and regular folks
to gain clarity and control in their finances and time management,
but currently it is a bit more suited to techies.
I use it every day to:

-   track spending and income
-   see time reports by day/week/month/project
-   get accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
-   track invoices

Though limited in features, hledger is lightweight, usable and reliable.
For some, it is a simpler, less distracting, more future-proof alternative to Quicken or GnuCash.
