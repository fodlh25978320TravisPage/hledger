Miscellaneous changes in the hledger project, as of each release.

(For package-specific changes, see the package changelogs.)

0.27 (2015/10/31)

- The site is now built with hakyll-std, a generic hakyll script.

- The hledger cabal files are now generated from package.yaml files by
  hpack, in principle, removing a lot of error-prone duplication and
  boilerplate.  (In practice, both files are being updated manually
  for the moment, until hpack supports flags and conditional blocks.)

- Time/allocation and heap profiling is working again, and easier:

  - `make quickprof-CMD` generates a profile for CMD, which runs
    against one of the sample journals. (CMD must be one word,
    enclosing in double quotes isn't working here for some reason).

  - `make quickheap-CMD` generates a heap profile for CMD, in
    hledgerprof.ps, and tries to open it in a viewer (currently the
    mac-friendly "open" executable, so you may need to adjust this in
    the makefile).  As with quickprof, CMD must be one word and runs
    against one of the sample journals.

  - `make hledgerprof` builds the hledgerprof executable used for
    time/allocation profiling. `make hledgercov` builds the hledgercov
    executable used for coverage reports.

- Travis CI now tests the build on each github push and announces
  status changes by email and on #hledger.

- hledger once again has a HCAR entry.

- Each hledger package now includes one or more man pages, generated
  from markdown by the mighty pandoc.  Currently there are six: one
  for each main executable and each input file format. Currently these
  somewhat duplicate the manual on the website; this will be resolved
  somehow.
