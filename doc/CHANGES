- change log/release note fixes


# 1.0 (2016/10/26)

## misc

-   added GHC 8 support, dropped GHC 7.6 and 7.8 support.

    GHC 7.8 support could be restored with small code changes and a maintainer.

-   a cabal.project file has been added (Moritz Kiefer)

-   use hpack for maintaining cabal files (#371).

    Instead of editing cabal files directly, we now edit the less
    verbose and less redundant package.yaml files and let stack (or
    hpack) update the cabal files. We commit both the .yaml and
    .cabal files.

-   clean up some old cabal flags

-   tools/simplebench has been spun off as the quickbench package.

-   add Appveyor CI builds, provide up-to-date binaries for Windows

-   extra: add a bunch of CSV rules examples

## docs

-   the website is simpler, clearer, and more mobile-friendly.

    Docs are now collected on a single page and organised by type: getting started, reference, more.

-   reference docs have been split into one manual for each executable and file format.

    This helps with maintenance and packaging and also should make it
    easier to see what's available and to read just what you need.

-   manuals are now provided in html, plain text, man and info formats

    generated from the same source by a new Shake-based docs build system. (#292)

-   versioned manuals are provided on the website, covering recent releases and the latest dev version (#385, #387)

-   manuals are built in to the hledger executables, allowing easy offline reading on all platforms.

        PROG -h              shows PROG's command-line usage
        PROG --help          shows PROG's manual (fixed width)
        PROG --man           shows PROG's manual with man (formatted/paged)
        PROG --info          shows PROG's manual with info (hypertext)
        hledger help [TOPIC] shows any manual
        hledger man  [TOPIC] shows any manual with man
        hledger info [TOPIC] shows any manual with info

-   the general and reporting options are now listed in all executable manuals.

    We assume any of them which are unsupported are harmlessly ignored.

-   demo.hledger.org is using beancount's example journal.

    This is the somewhat realistic example journal from the beancount
    project, tweaked for hledger.

-   minor copyedits (jungle-boogie)

## cli

-   parsing multiple input files is now robust.

    When multiple -f options are provided, we now parse each file
    individually rather than just concatenating them, so they can
    have different formats (#320).  Note this also means that
    directives (like \`Y\` or \`alias\`) no longer carry over from one
    file to the next.

-   -I has been added as the short flag for --ignore-assertions

    (this is different from Ledger's CLI, but useful for hledger-ui).

-   parsing an argument-less --debug option is more robust



0.27 (2015/10/31)

- The site is now built with hakyll-std, a generic hakyll script.

- The hledger cabal files are now generated from package.yaml files by
  hpack, in principle, removing a lot of error-prone duplication and
  boilerplate.  (In practice, both files are being updated manually
  for the moment, until hpack supports flags and conditional blocks.)

- Time/allocation and heap profiling is working again, and easier:

  - `make quickprof-CMD` generates a profile for CMD, which runs
    against one of the sample journals. (CMD must be one word,
    enclosing in double quotes isn't working here for some reason).

  - `make quickheap-CMD` generates a heap profile for CMD, in
    hledgerprof.ps, and tries to open it in a viewer (currently the
    mac-friendly "open" executable, so you may need to adjust this in
    the makefile).  As with quickprof, CMD must be one word and runs
    against one of the sample journals.

  - `make hledgerprof` builds the hledgerprof executable used for
    time/allocation profiling. `make hledgercov` builds the hledgercov
    executable used for coverage reports.

- Travis CI now tests the build on each github push and announces
  status changes by email and on #hledger.

- hledger once again has a HCAR entry.

- Each hledger package now includes one or more man pages, generated
  from markdown by the mighty pandoc.  Currently there are six: one
  for each main executable and each input file format. Currently these
  somewhat duplicate the manual on the website; this will be resolved
  somehow.
