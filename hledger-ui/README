A curses-style text user interface for the hledger accounting tool.

hledger-ui is the new name for hledger-vty. Revived in 2015, this
package is intended to be installed as standard by all hledger users,
except those on (native) Windows, where it is not supported.

hledger-ui currently allows browsing the balance, register and print
reports, with drill-down and scrolling.
