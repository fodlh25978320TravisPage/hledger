0.27 (unreleased)

- hledger-ui is a new curses-style UI, intended to be a standard part
  of the hledger toolset for all users (except on native MS Windows,
  where the vty lib is not yet supported).

    The UI is quite simple, allowing just browsing of accounts and
  transactions, but it has a number of improvements over the old
  hledger-vty, which it replaces:

    - adapts to screen size
    - handles wide characters
    - shows multi-commodity amounts on one line
    - manages cursor and scroll position better
    - allows depth adjustment
    - allows --flat toggle
    - allows --cleared toggle
    - allows journal reloading
    - shows a more useful transaction register, like hledger-web
    - offers multiple color themes
    - includes some built-in help

    hledger-ui is built with brick, a new higher-level UI library based
  on vty, making it relatively easy to grow and maintain.
