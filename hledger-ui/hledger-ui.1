hledger\-ui \- curses\-style interface for the hledger accounting tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]hledger\-ui\ [OPTIONS]\ [QUERYARGS]\f[]
.PD 0

\f[C]hledger\ ui\ \-\-\ [OPTIONS]\ [QUERYARGS]\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hledger is a cross\-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
other commodity, using double\-entry accounting and a simple, editable
file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1).
.PP
hledger\-ui is hledger\[aq]s curses\-style interface.
It reads a hledger journal file (~/.hledger.journal, $LEDGER_FILE, or
\-f FILE) and provides a simple full\-screen console interface for
viewing account balances and transactions.
It is simpler and more convenient for browsing than the command\-line
interface, but lighter and faster than hledger\-web.
.PP
The journal file is \f[C]~/.hledger.journal\f[], \f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[],
or another file specified with \-f.
For more about the format, see hledger(1) or hledger_journal(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP

.SH KEYS
.PP
Generally the cursor keys navigate; \f[C]right\f[] (or \f[C]enter\f[])
goes deeper, \f[C]left\f[] returns to the previous screen,
\f[C]up\f[]/\f[C]down\f[]/\f[C]page\ up\f[]/\f[C]page\ down\f[]/\f[C]home\f[]/\f[C]end\f[]
move up and down through lists.
.PP
\f[C]g\f[] gets the latest data and reloads the screen (and any previous
screens).
There may be a noticeable pause.
.PP
\f[C]q\f[] quits the application.
.PP
Some screens have additional key bindings, described below.
.SH SCREENS
.SS Accounts screen
.PP
This is normally the first screen displayed.
It lists accounts and their balances, like hledger\[aq]s balance
command.
By default, it shows all accounts and their latest ending balances.
if you specify a query on the command line, it shows just the matched
accounts and the balances from matched transactions.
.PP
When not in flat mode, indentation indicates the account hierarchy.
\f[C]F\f[] toggles flat mode on and off.
.PP
By default, all subaccounts are displayed.
To see less detail, set a depth limit by pressing a number key,
\f[C]1\f[] to \f[C]9\f[].
Or, adjust the depth limit by pressing \f[C]\-\f[] or \f[C]+\f[]
(\f[C]=\f[] also works).
\f[C]0\f[] removes the depth limit.
.PP
\f[C]C\f[] toggles cleared mode.
In cleared mode, the accounts and balances are derived only from
transactions which are marked cleared (*).
.PP
Press \f[C]right\f[] or \f[C]enter\f[] to view an account\[aq]s
transactions register.
.SS Register screen
.PP
This screen lists all transactions affecting a particular account (like
a check register).
In cleared mode (press \f[C]C\f[]) it lists only transactions which are
marked cleared.
It does not otherwise filter by query.
.PP
Note this screen shows transactions, not postings (unlike hledger\[aq]s
register command).
This means:
.IP \[bu] 2
Each line represents a whole transaction.
.IP \[bu] 2
For each transaction, it shows the other account(s) involved, in
abbreviated form.
(If there are both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts
affected by real postings.)
.IP \[bu] 2
It shows the overall change to the current account\[aq]s balance from
each transaction; positive for an inflow to this account, negative for
an outflow.
.IP \[bu] 2
When no query other than a date limit is in effect, it shows the current
account\[aq]s historic balance as of the transaction date.
Otherwise it shows a running total starting from zero.
Eg, these will show historic balances:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ hledger\-ui
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-begin\ \[aq]this\ month\[aq]
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-register\ checking\ date:2015/10
\f[]
.fi
.PP
while these will show a running total, since the queries are not just
date limits:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ hledger\-ui\ checking
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-begin\ \[aq]this\ month\[aq]\ desc:market
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-register\ checking\ \-\-cleared
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
Press \f[C]right\f[] or \f[C]enter\f[] to view the selected transaction
in full detail.
.SS Transaction screen
.PP
This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger\[aq]s print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).
.PP
The transaction\[aq]s date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).
.PP
\f[C]up\f[] and \f[C]down\f[] will step through all transactions listed
in the previous account register screen.
In the title bar, the numbers in parentheses show your position within
that account register.
They will vary depending on which account register you came from
(remember most transactions appear in multiple account registers).
The #N number preceding them is the transaction\[aq]s position within
the complete unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least
until the next reload).
.SS Error screen
.PP
This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload.
Once you have fixed the problem described, press g again to reload and
restore normal operation.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE\f[] sets the default journal file path.
If not set, it is \f[C]~/.hledger.journal\f[].
.PP
\f[B]COLUMNS\f[] sets the screen width to use (normally the full
terminal width).
.SH FILES
.PP
Reads data from a hledger journal file (\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[] or
\f[C]~/.hledger.journal\f[] by default), or a CSV file plus associated
CSV rules file.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The need to precede options with \f[C]\-\-\f[] when invoked from hledger
is awkward.
.PP
\f[C]\-f\-\f[] doesn\[aq]t work (hledger\-ui can\[aq]t read from stdin).
.PP
\f[C]\-V\f[] affects only the accounts screen.
.PP
When you press \f[C]g\f[], the current and all previous screens are
regenerated, which may cause a noticeable pause.
Also there is no visual indication that this is in progress.
.PP
The register screen\[aq]s switching between historic balance and running
total based on query arguments may be confusing, and there is no column
heading to indicate which is being displayed.
