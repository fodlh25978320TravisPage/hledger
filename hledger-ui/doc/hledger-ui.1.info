*****************************

hledger-ui is hledger's curses-style interface, providing an efficient
full-window text UI for viewing accounts and transactions, and some
limited data entry capability. It is easier than hledger's command-line
interface, and sometimes quicker and more convenient than the web
interface.

   Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger
journal, timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with `-f', or
`$LEDGER_FILE', or `$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
`C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal'). For more about this see hledger(1),
hledger_journal(5) etc.

1 OPTIONS
*********

Note: if invoking hledger-ui as a hledger subcommand, write `--' before
options as shown above.

   Any QUERYARGS are interpreted as a hledger search query which filters
the data.

`--flat'
     show full account names, unindented

`--no-elide'
     don't compress empty parent accounts on one line

`--register=ACCTREGEX'
     start in the (first) matched account's register screen

`--theme=default|terminal|greenterm'
     use this custom display theme

`-V --value'
     show amounts as their current market value in their default
     valuation commodity (accounts screen only)

   hledger general options:

`-h'
     show general usage (or after COMMAND, the command's usage)

`--help'
     show the current program's manual as plain text (or after an add-on
     COMMAND, the add-on's manual)

`--man'
     show the current program's manual with man

`--info'
     show the current program's manual with info

`--version'
     show version

`--debug=N'
     show debug output if N is 1-9 (default: 0)

`-f FILE --file=FILE'
     use a different input file. For stdin, use -

`--rules-file=RULESFILE'
     Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)

`--alias=OLD=NEW'
     display accounts named OLD as NEW

`--ignore-assertions'
     ignore any failing balance assertions in the journal

   hledger reporting options:

`-b --begin=DATE'
     include postings/txns on or after this date

`-e --end=DATE'
     include postings/txns before this date

`-D --daily'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by day

`-W --weekly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by week

`-M --monthly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by month

`-Q --quarterly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by quarter

`-Y --yearly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by year

`-p --period=PERIODEXP'
     set start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
     (overrides the flags above)

`--date2'
     show, and match with -b/-e/-p/date:, secondary dates instead

`-C --cleared'
     include only cleared postings/txns

`--pending'
     include only pending postings/txns

`-U --uncleared'
     include only uncleared (and pending) postings/txns

`-R --real'
     include only non-virtual postings

`--depth=N'
     hide accounts/postings deeper than N

`-E --empty'
     show items with zero amount, normally hidden

`-B --cost'
     show amounts in their cost price's commodity

`--pivot TAG'
     will transform the journal before any other processing by
     replacing the account name of every posting having the tag TAG
     with content VALUE by the account name "TAG:VALUE".  The TAG will
     only match if it is a full-length match. The pivot will only
     happen if the TAG is on a posting, not if it is on the transaction.
     If the tag value is a multi:level:account:name the new account
     name will be "TAG:multi:level:account:name".

2 KEYS
******

`?' shows a help dialog listing all keys. (Some but not all of these
also appear in the quick help at the bottom of each screen.) Press `?'
again (or `ESCAPE', or `LEFT') to close it.

   The cursor keys navigate: `right' (or `enter') goes deeper, `left'
returns to the previous screen, `up'/`down'/`page up'/`page
down'/`home'/`end' move up and down through lists. Vi-style
`h'/`j'/`k'/`l' movement keys are also supported.

   `/' lets you set or change the filter query, which limits the data
shown on most screens (in addition to the quick filters described
below). While editing the query you can use typical command-line edit
keys (ctrl-a/e/k), press enter to set the new filter, or press escape to
cancel.

   `BACKSPACE' or `DELETE' clears any filters in effect.

   `ESCAPE' removes any filters currently in effect, and jumps to the
top screen. Or, it cancels a minibuffer edit or help dialog if one is
active.

   `g' reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen and
any previous screens. (With large files, there can be a noticeable
pause.)

   `a' runs command-line hledger's add command, and reloads the updated
file. This allows some basic data entry.

   `E' runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR, or $EDITOR, or a default (emacs) on the
journal file. When invoked from the register and transaction screens,
the cursor will be positioned at the current transaction. When invoked
from the error screen, the cursor will be at the error location (if
possible).

   `q' quits the application.

   Additional screen-specific keys are described below.

3 SCREENS
*********

* Menu:

* Accounts screen::
* Register screen::
* Transaction screen::
* Error screen::


File: hledger-ui.1.info,  Node: Accounts screen,  Next: Register screen,  Up: SCREENS

3.1 Accounts screen
===================

This is normally the first screen displayed. It lists accounts and their
balances, like hledger's balance command. By default, it shows all
accounts and their latest ending balances. if you specify a query on the
command line, it shows just the matched accounts and the balances from
matched transactions.

   Account names are normally indented to show the hierarchy (tree
mode).  To see less detail, set a depth limit by pressing a number key,
`1' to `9'. `0' shows even less detail, collapsing all accounts to a
single total. `-' and `+' (or `=') decrease and increase the depth
limit. To remove the depth limit, set it higher than the maximum
account depth, or press `ESCAPE'.

   `F' toggles flat mode on and off. In flat mode, accounts are listed
without indentation (and account registers will exclude subaccounts, see
below).

   `C' toggles cleared mode, in which uncleared transactions and
postings are not shown. `U' toggles uncleared mode, in which only
uncleared transactions/postings are shown.

   `R' toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

   `Z' toggles nonzero mode, in which only accounts with nonzero
balances are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command-line hledger).

   Press `right' or `enter' to view an account's transactions register.


File: hledger-ui.1.info,  Node: Register screen,  Next: Transaction screen,  Prev: Accounts screen,  Up: SCREENS

3.2 Register screen
===================

This screen shows the transactions affecting a particular account, like
a check register. Each line represents one transaction and shows:

   * the other account(s) involved, in abbreviated form. (If there are
     both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts
     affected by real postings.)

   * the overall change to the current account's balance; positive for
     an inflow to this account, negative for an outflow.

   * the current account's historic balance (if no query other than a
     date limit is in effect) or the running total starting from zero
     (otherwise), after the transaction.
     Eg, these will show historic balances:


     $ hledger-ui
     $ hledger-ui --begin 'this month'
     $ hledger-ui --register checking date:2015/10

     while these will show a running total, since the queries are not
     just date limits:


     $ hledger-ui checking
     $ hledger-ui --begin 'this month' desc:market
     $ hledger-ui --register checking --cleared


   Normally the register screen shows transactions in the current
account and any of its subaccounts (inclusive mode). If it was entered
from accounts screen in flat mode, it shows transactions affecting this
account specifically, without considering subaccounts (exclusive mode).
As on the accounts screen you can toggle this with the `F' key.

   `C' toggles cleared mode, in which uncleared transactions and
postings are not shown. `U' toggles uncleared mode, in which only
uncleared transactions/postings are shown.

   `R' toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

   `Z' toggles nonzero mode, in which only transactions posting a
nonzero change are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command-line hledger).

   Press `right' (or `enter') to view the selected transaction in
detail.


File: hledger-ui.1.info,  Node: Transaction screen,  Next: Error screen,  Prev: Register screen,  Up: SCREENS

3.3 Transaction screen
======================

This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger's print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).

   The transaction's date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).

   `up' and `down' will step through all transactions listed in the
previous account register screen. In the title bar, the numbers in
parentheses show your position within that account register. They will
vary depending on which account register you came from (remember most
transactions appear in multiple account registers). The #N number
preceding them is the transaction's position within the complete
unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least until the next
reload).

3.4 Error screen
================

This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload. Once you have fixed the problem, press g
again to reload and resume normal operation. (Or, you can press escape
to cancel the reload attempt.)
