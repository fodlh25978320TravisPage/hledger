       hledger-ui - curses-style interface for the hledger accounting tool

       hledger ui -- [OPTIONS] [QUERYARGS]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       hledger  is  a  cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
       other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a  simple,  editable
       file  format.   hledger  is  inspired  by  and  largely compatible with
       ledger(1).

       hledger-ui is hledger's curses-style interface.   It  reads  a  hledger
       journal file

       (~/.hledger.journal,  $LEDGER_FILE,  or  -f  FILE;  see  hledger(1)  or
       hledger_journal(5))

       and provides a simple full-screen console interface for viewing account
       balances and transactions.

       It  is  simpler  and more convenient for browsing than the command-line
       interface, but lighter and faster than hledger-web.

       The journal file is ~/.hledger.journal, $LEDGER_FILE, or  another  file
       specified  with  -f.   For  more  about  the  format, see hledger(1) or
       hledger_journal(5).

       Note: if invoking hledger-ui as a hledger subcommand, write  --  before
       options as shown above.

       Any  QUERYARGS  are interpreted as a hledger search query which filters
       the data.

KKEEYYSS
       Generally  the cursor keys navigate; right (or enter) goes deeper, left
       returns to the previous screen, up/down/page up/page down/home/end move
       up and down through lists.

       g  gets  the  latest  data  and  reloads  the  screen (and any previous
       screens).  There may be a noticeable pause.

       q quits the application.

       Some screens have additional key bindings, described below.

SSCCRREEEENNSS
   AAccccoouunnttss ssccrreeeenn
       This is normally the first screen displayed.   It  lists  accounts  and
       their  balances,  like hledger's balance command.  By default, it shows
       all accounts and their latest ending balances.  if you specify a  query
       on  the  command  line, it shows just the matched accounts and the bal-
       ances from matched transactions.

       When not in flat mode, indentation indicates the account hierarchy.   F
       toggles flat mode on and off.

       By  default,  all subaccounts are displayed.  To see less detail, set a
       depth limit by pressing a number key, 1 to 9.   Or,  adjust  the  depth
       limit by pressing - or + (= also works).  0 removes the depth limit.

       C toggles cleared mode.  In cleared mode, the accounts and balances are
       derived only from transactions which are marked cleared (*).

       Press right or enter to view an account's transactions register.

   RReeggiisstteerr ssccrreeeenn
       This screen lists all transactions affecting a particular account (like
       a  check  register).   In cleared mode (press C) it lists only transac-
       tions which are marked cleared.  It does not otherwise filter by query.

       Note  this  screen  shows  transactions, not postings (unlike hledger's
       register command).  This means:

       +o Each line represents a whole transaction.

       +o For each transaction, it shows  the  other  account(s)  involved,  in
         abbreviated  form.   (If there are both real and virtual postings, it
         shows only the accounts affected by real postings.)

       +o It shows the overall change to the  current  account's  balance  from
         each  transaction;  positive  for an inflow to this account, negative
         for an outflow.

       +o When no query other than a date limit is in effect, it shows the cur-
         rent  account's  historic balance as of the transaction date.  Other-
         wise it shows a running total starting from  zero.   Eg,  these  will
         show historic balances:

                $ hledger-ui
                $ hledger-ui --begin 'this month'
                $ hledger-ui --register checking date:2015/10

         while these will show a running total, since the queries are not just
         date limits:

                $ hledger-ui checking
                $ hledger-ui --begin 'this month' desc:market
                $ hledger-ui --register checking --cleared

       Press right or enter to view the selected transaction in full detail.

   TTrraannssaaccttiioonn ssccrreeeenn
       This screen shows a single transaction, as  a  general  journal  entry,
       similar  to  hledger's  print command and journal format (hledger_jour-
       nal(5)).

       The transaction's date(s)  and  any  cleared  flag,  transaction  code,
       description,  comments,  along  with  all  of  its account postings are
       shown.  Simple transactions have two postings, but there  can  be  more
       (or in certain cases, fewer).

       up  and  down will step through all transactions listed in the previous
       account register screen.  In the title bar, the numbers in  parentheses
       show  your  position  within  that  account  register.   They will vary
       depending on which account register you came from (remember most trans-
       actions appear in multiple account registers).  The #N number preceding
       them is the transaction's position within the complete unfiltered jour-
       nal, which is a more stable id (at least until the next reload).

   EErrrroorr ssccrreeeenn
       This  screen  will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
       when you press g to reload.  Once you have fixed the problem described,
       press g again to reload and restore normal operation.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       LLEEDDGGEERR__FFIILLEE  sets  the  default  journal  file path.  If not set, it is
       ~/.hledger.journal.

       CCOOLLUUMMNNSS sets the screen  width  to  use  (normally  the  full  terminal
       width).

FFIILLEESS
       Reads   data   from   a   hledger   journal   file   ($LEDGER_FILE   or
       ~/.hledger.journal by default), or a CSV file plus associated CSV rules
       file.

BBUUGGSS
       The  need  to precede options with -- when invoked from hledger is awk-
       ward.

       -f- doesn't work (hledger-ui can't read from stdin).

       -V affects only the accounts screen.

       When you press g, the current and all previous screens are regenerated,
       which may cause a noticeable pause.  Also there is no visual indication
       that this is in progress.

       The register screen's switching between historic  balance  and  running
       total based on query arguments may be confusing, and there is no column
       heading to indicate which is being displayed.
