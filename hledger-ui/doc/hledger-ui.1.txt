       hledger ui -- [OPTIONS] [QUERYARGS]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       hledger  is  a  cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
       other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a  simple,  editable
       file  format.   hledger  is  inspired  by  and  largely compatible with
       ledger(1).

       hledger-ui is hledger's curses-style interface, providing an  efficient
       full-window  text  UI  for  viewing accounts and transactions, and some
       limited data entry  capability.   It  is  easier  than  hledger's  com-
       mand-line interface, and sometimes quicker and more convenient than the
       web interface.

       Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger  journal,
       timeclock,  timedot,  or CSV format specified with -f, or $LEDGER_FILE,
       or       $HOME/.hledger.journal       (on       windows,        perhaps
       C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal).   For  more about this see hledger(1),
       hledger_journal(5) etc.

       Note: if invoking hledger-ui as a hledger subcommand, write  --  before
       options as shown above.

       Any  QUERYARGS  are interpreted as a hledger search query which filters
       the data.

              will transform  the  journal  before  any  other  processing  by
              replacing  the  account name of every posting having the tag TAG
              with content VALUE by the account name "TAG:VALUE".
       The TAG will only match if it is a full-length match.  The  pivot  will
       only  happen  if  the TAG is on a posting, not if it is on the transac-
       tion.  If the tag value is a multi:level:account:name the  new  account
       name will be "TAG:multi:level:account:name".

KKEEYYSS
       h  shows  a  help  dialog listing all keys.  (Some but not all of these
       also appear in the quick help at the bottom of each  screen.)  Press  h
       again (or ESCAPE) to close it.

       The cursor keys navigate: right (or enter) goes deeper, left returns to
       the previous screen,  up/down/page up/page down/home/end  move  up  and
       down through lists.

       /  lets you set or change the filter query, which limits the data shown
       on most screens (in addition to the  quick  filters  described  below).
       While  editing  the  query  you  can use typical command-line edit keys
       (ctrl-a/e/k), press enter to set the new filter,  or  press  escape  to
       cancel.

       BACKSPACE or DELETE clears any filters in effect.

       ESCAPE  removes  any  filters currently in effect, and jumps to the top
       screen.  Or, it cancels a minibuffer edit or  help  dialog  if  one  is
       active.

       g  reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen and any
       previous screens.  (With large files, there can be a noticeable pause.)

       a  runs  command-line  hledger's  add  command, and reloads the updated
       file.  This allows some basic data entry.

       q quits the application.

       Additional screen-specific keys are described below.

SSCCRREEEENNSS
   AAccccoouunnttss ssccrreeeenn
       This is normally the first screen displayed.   It  lists  accounts  and
       their  balances,  like hledger's balance command.  By default, it shows
       all accounts and their latest ending balances.  if you specify a  query
       on  the  command  line, it shows just the matched accounts and the bal-
       ances from matched transactions.

       When not in flat mode, indentation indicates the account hierarchy.   F
       toggles flat mode on and off.

       By  default,  all subaccounts are displayed.  To see less detail, set a
       depth limit by pressing a number key,  1  to  9.   0  shows  even  less
       detail,  collapsing  all  accounts to a single total.  - and + decrease
       and increase the depth limit.  To remove the depth limit  press  =,  or
       just keep increasing it.

       C  toggles  cleared  mode, in which uncleared transactions and postings
       are not shown.  U toggles  uncleared  mode,  in  which  only  uncleared
       transactions/postings are shown.

       R toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

       E  toggles  nonzero  mode, in which only accounts with nonzero balances
       are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike  command-line
       hledger).

       Press right or enter to view an account's transactions register.

   RReeggiisstteerr ssccrreeeenn
       This screen lists all transactions affecting a particular account, like
       a check register.  Unlike hledger's register command (which lists indi-
       vidual postings), in hledger-ui's register:

       +o Each line represents a whole transaction.

       +o For  each  transaction,  it  shows  the other account(s) involved, in
         abbreviated form.  (If there are both real and virtual  postings,  it
         shows only the accounts affected by real postings.)

       +o It  shows  the  overall  change to the current account's balance from
         each transaction; positive for an inflow to  this  account,  negative
         for an outflow.

       +o When no query other than a date limit is in effect, it shows the cur-
         rent account's historic balance as of the transaction  date.   Other-
         wise  it  shows  a  running total starting from zero.  Eg, these will
         show historic balances:

                $ hledger-ui
                $ hledger-ui --begin 'this month'
                $ hledger-ui --register checking date:2015/10

         while these will show a running total, since the queries are not just
         date limits:

                $ hledger-ui checking
                $ hledger-ui --begin 'this month' desc:market
                $ hledger-ui --register checking --cleared

       C  toggles  cleared  mode, in which uncleared transactions and postings
       are not shown.  U toggles  uncleared  mode,  in  which  only  uncleared
       transactions/postings are shown.

       R toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

       E  toggles  nonzero  mode, in which only transactions posting a nonzero
       change are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default,  unlike  com-
       mand-line hledger).

       Press right (or enter) to view the selected transaction in full detail.

       Note, filter queries which filter by account name are not  very  useful
       on this screen yet.

   TTrraannssaaccttiioonn ssccrreeeenn
       This  screen  shows  a  single transaction, as a general journal entry,
       similar to hledger's print command and  journal  format  (hledger_jour-
       nal(5)).

       The  transaction's  date(s)  and  any  cleared  flag, transaction code,
       description, comments, along with  all  of  its  account  postings  are
       shown.   Simple  transactions  have two postings, but there can be more
       (or in certain cases, fewer).

       up and down will step through all transactions listed in  the  previous
       account  register screen.  In the title bar, the numbers in parentheses
       show your position  within  that  account  register.   They  will  vary
       depending on which account register you came from (remember most trans-
       actions appear in multiple account registers).  The #N number preceding
       them is the transaction's position within the complete unfiltered jour-
       nal, which is a more stable id (at least until the next reload).

   EErrrroorr ssccrreeeenn
       This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a  parse  error,
       when  you  press g to reload.  Once you have fixed the problem, press g
       again to reload and resume normal operation.  (Or, you can press escape
       to cancel the reload attempt.)

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       CCOOLLUUMMNNSS The screen width to use.  Default: the full terminal width.

       LLEEDDGGEERR__FFIILLEE The journal file path when not specified with -f.  Default:
       ~/.hledger.journal (on  windows,  perhaps  C:/Users/USER/.hledger.jour-
       nal).

FFIILLEESS
       Reads  data from one or more files in hledger journal, timeclock, time-
       dot,  or  CSV  format  specified   with   -f,   or   $LEDGER_FILE,   or
       $HOME/.hledger.journal           (on          windows,          perhaps
       C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal).

BBUUGGSS
       The need to precede options with -- when invoked from hledger  is  awk-
       ward.

       -f- doesn't work (hledger-ui can't read from stdin).

       -V affects only the accounts screen.

       When you press g, the current and all previous screens are regenerated,
       which may cause a noticeable pause.  Also there is no visual indication
       that this is in progress.

       The  register  screen's  switching between historic balance and running
       total based on query arguments may be confusing, and there is no column
       heading to indicate which is being displayed.
