hledger\-ui \- curses\-style interface for the hledger accounting tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP

.PD 0

\f[C]hledger\ ui\ \-\-\ [OPTIONS]\ [QUERYARGS]\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hledger is a cross\-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
other commodity, using double\-entry accounting and a simple, editable
file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1).
.PP
hledger\-ui is hledger\[aq]s curses\-style interface, providing an
efficient full\-window text UI for viewing accounts and transactions,
and some limited data entry capability.
It is easier than hledger\[aq]s command\-line interface, and sometimes
quicker and more convenient than the web interface.
.PP
Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]\-f\f[], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
For more about this see hledger(1), hledger_journal(5) etc.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP

be "TAG:multi:level:account:name".
.RS
.RE
.SH KEYS
.PP
\f[C]h\f[] shows a help dialog listing all keys.
(Some but not all of these also appear in the quick help at the bottom
of each screen.) Press \f[C]h\f[] again (or \f[C]ESCAPE\f[]) to close
it.
.PP
The cursor keys navigate: \f[C]right\f[] (or \f[C]enter\f[]) goes
deeper, \f[C]left\f[] returns to the previous screen,
\f[C]up\f[]/\f[C]down\f[]/\f[C]page\ up\f[]/\f[C]page\ down\f[]/\f[C]home\f[]/\f[C]end\f[]
move up and down through lists.
.PP
\f[C]/\f[] lets you set or change the filter query, which limits the
data shown on most screens (in addition to the quick filters described
below).
While editing the query you can use typical command\-line edit keys
(ctrl\-a/e/k), press enter to set the new filter, or press escape to
cancel.
.PP
\f[C]BACKSPACE\f[] or \f[C]DELETE\f[] clears any filters in effect.
.PP
\f[C]ESCAPE\f[] removes any filters currently in effect, and jumps to
the top screen.
Or, it cancels a minibuffer edit or help dialog if one is active.
.PP
\f[C]g\f[] reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen
and any previous screens.
(With large files, there can be a noticeable pause.)
.PP
\f[C]a\f[] runs command\-line hledger\[aq]s add command, and reloads the
updated file.
This allows some basic data entry.
.PP
\f[C]q\f[] quits the application.
.PP
Additional screen\-specific keys are described below.
.SH SCREENS
.SS Accounts screen
.PP
This is normally the first screen displayed.
It lists accounts and their balances, like hledger\[aq]s balance
command.
By default, it shows all accounts and their latest ending balances.
if you specify a query on the command line, it shows just the matched
accounts and the balances from matched transactions.
.PP
When not in flat mode, indentation indicates the account hierarchy.
\f[C]F\f[] toggles flat mode on and off.
.PP
By default, all subaccounts are displayed.
To see less detail, set a depth limit by pressing a number key,
\f[C]1\f[] to \f[C]9\f[].
\f[C]0\f[] shows even less detail, collapsing all accounts to a single
total.
\f[C]\-\f[] and \f[C]+\f[] decrease and increase the depth limit.
To remove the depth limit press \f[C]=\f[], or just keep increasing it.
.PP
\f[C]C\f[] toggles cleared mode, in which uncleared transactions and
postings are not shown.
\f[C]U\f[] toggles uncleared mode, in which only uncleared
transactions/postings are shown.
.PP
\f[C]R\f[] toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.
.PP
\f[C]E\f[] toggles nonzero mode, in which only accounts with nonzero
balances are shown (hledger\-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command\-line hledger).
.PP
Press \f[C]right\f[] or \f[C]enter\f[] to view an account\[aq]s
transactions register.
.SS Register screen
.PP
This screen lists all transactions affecting a particular account, like
a check register.
Unlike hledger\[aq]s register command (which lists individual postings),
in hledger\-ui\[aq]s register:
.IP \[bu] 2
Each line represents a whole transaction.
.IP \[bu] 2
For each transaction, it shows the other account(s) involved, in
abbreviated form.
(If there are both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts
affected by real postings.)
.IP \[bu] 2
It shows the overall change to the current account\[aq]s balance from
each transaction; positive for an inflow to this account, negative for
an outflow.
.IP \[bu] 2
When no query other than a date limit is in effect, it shows the current
account\[aq]s historic balance as of the transaction date.
Otherwise it shows a running total starting from zero.
Eg, these will show historic balances:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ hledger\-ui
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-begin\ \[aq]this\ month\[aq]
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-register\ checking\ date:2015/10
\f[]
.fi
.PP
while these will show a running total, since the queries are not just
date limits:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ hledger\-ui\ checking
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-begin\ \[aq]this\ month\[aq]\ desc:market
$\ hledger\-ui\ \-\-register\ checking\ \-\-cleared
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
\f[C]C\f[] toggles cleared mode, in which uncleared transactions and
postings are not shown.
\f[C]U\f[] toggles uncleared mode, in which only uncleared
transactions/postings are shown.
.PP
\f[C]R\f[] toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.
.PP
\f[C]E\f[] toggles nonzero mode, in which only transactions posting a
nonzero change are shown (hledger\-ui shows zero items by default,
unlike command\-line hledger).
.PP
Press \f[C]right\f[] (or \f[C]enter\f[]) to view the selected
transaction in full detail.
.PP
Note, filter queries which filter by account name are not very useful on
this screen yet.
.SS Transaction screen
.PP
This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger\[aq]s print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).
.PP
The transaction\[aq]s date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).
.PP
\f[C]up\f[] and \f[C]down\f[] will step through all transactions listed
in the previous account register screen.
In the title bar, the numbers in parentheses show your position within
that account register.
They will vary depending on which account register you came from
(remember most transactions appear in multiple account registers).
The #N number preceding them is the transaction\[aq]s position within
the complete unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least
until the next reload).
.SS Error screen
.PP
This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload.
Once you have fixed the problem, press g again to reload and resume
normal operation.
(Or, you can press escape to cancel the reload attempt.)
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\f[B]COLUMNS\f[] The screen width to use.
Default: the full terminal width.
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE\f[] The journal file path when not specified with
\f[C]\-f\f[].
Default: \f[C]~/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows, perhaps
\f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
.SH FILES
.PP
Reads data from one or more files in hledger journal, timeclock,
timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]\-f\f[], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
.SH BUGS
.PP
The need to precede options with \f[C]\-\-\f[] when invoked from hledger
is awkward.
.PP
\f[C]\-f\-\f[] doesn\[aq]t work (hledger\-ui can\[aq]t read from stdin).
.PP
\f[C]\-V\f[] affects only the accounts screen.
.PP
When you press \f[C]g\f[], the current and all previous screens are
regenerated, which may cause a noticeable pause.
Also there is no visual indication that this is in progress.
.PP
The register screen\[aq]s switching between historic balance and running
total based on query arguments may be confusing, and there is no column
heading to indicate which is being displayed.
