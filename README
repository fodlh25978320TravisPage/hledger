hledger - a ledger-compatible text-based accounting tool.

Copyright (c) 2007-2008 Simon Michael <simon@joyful.com>
Released under GPL version 3 or later.

This is a minimal haskell clone of John Wiegley's ledger
<http://newartisans.com/software/ledger.html>.  hledger does basic
register & balance reports, and demonstrates a (naive) purely
functional implementation of ledger.

Installation:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure
runhaskell Setup.hs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install 
 (or symlink dist/build/hledger/hledger into your path)

Examples:

hledger -f sample.ledger balance
export LEDGER=sample.ledger
hledger -s balance
hledger register
hledger reg cash
hledger reg -- shop

This version of hledger was intended to mimic ledger 2.5 as closely as
possible, see the ledger manual for more info:
<http://joyful.com/repos/hledger/doc/ledger.html>.

Bugs:

* timelog parser doesn't work
