Welcome to hledger! 

hledger is a partial haskell clone of John Wiegley's text-based accounting
tool, ledger (http://wiki.github.com/jwiegley/ledger). hledger generates
ledger-compatible register & balance reports from a plain text journal,
allows precise batch-mode or interactive querying, and demonstrates a pure
functional implementation of ledger.  For more information, see
http://hledger.org .

Installation
------------

Building hledger requires GHC (http://haskell.org/ghc); it is known to
build with GHC 6.8 and up. hledger should work on any platform which GHC
supports.  

Also, installing hledger easily requires the "cabal" command-line tool,
version 0.6.0 and up (http://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html). (You
can manually download and install each dependency mentioned in
hledger.cabal from hackage.org, but installing cabal is much quicker.)

Here's how to download and install the latest hledger release::

 cabal update
 cabal install hledger (add -f happs to include the web ui)

Or, to get the latest development code::

 darcs get http://joyful.com/repos/hledger


Usage
-----

hledger looks for your ledger file at ~/.ledger by default. To use a
different file, specify it with the LEDGER environment variable or -f
option (which may be - for standard input). Basic usage is::

 hledger [OPTIONS] [COMMAND [PATTERNS]]

COMMAND is one of balance, print, register, ui, web, test (defaulting to
balance). PATTERNS are zero or more regular expressions used to narrow the
results.  Here are some commands to try::

 export LEDGER=sample.ledger
 hledger --help                        # show usage & options
 hledger balance                       # all accounts with aggregated balances
 hledger bal --depth 1                 # only top-level accounts
 hledger register                      # transaction register
 hledger reg income                    # transactions to/from an income account
 hledger reg checking                  # checking transactions
 hledger reg desc:shop                 # transactions with shop in the description
 hledger ui                            # interactive ui, if you're on unix/mac
 hledger web                           # web ui, if you installed with -f happs


Time reporting
--------------
hledger will also read timeclock.el-format timelog entries.  As a
convenience, if you invoke the hledger executable via a link or copy named
"hours", it looks for your timelog file (~/.timelog, or the file specified
by $TIMELOG or -f), and parses arguments slightly differently::

 hours [OPTIONS] [PERIOD [COMMAND [PATTERNS]]]

where PERIOD is a ledger-style period expression, defaulting to "today",
and COMMAND is one of the commands above. Timelog entries look like this::

 i 2009/03/31 22:21:45 some:project
 o 2009/04/01 02:00:34

The project description is like an account name. Here are some queries to try::

 ln -s `which hledger` ~/bin/hours     # add the "hours" symlink in your path
 export TIMELOG=/my/timelog            # if it's not ~/.timelog
 hours                                 # today's balances
 hours today                           # the same
 hours 'this week'                     # so far this week
 hours lastmonth                       # the space is optional
 hours 'from 1/15' register            # sessions since last january 15
 hours 'monthly in 2009' reg --depth 1 # monthly time summary, top level only

Features
--------

This version of hledger mimics a subset of ledger 3.x, and adds some
features of its own. We currently support regular ledger entries, timelog
entries, multiple commodities, virtual transactions, account and
description patterns, the LEDGER environment variable, and these commands
and options::

   Commands:
   balance  [REGEXP]...   show balance totals for matching accounts
   register [REGEXP]...   show register of matching transactions
   print    [REGEXP]...   print all matching entries

   Basic options:
   -h, --help             show summarized help
   -f, --file FILE        read ledger data from FILE
 
   Report filtering:
   -b, --begin DATE       report on entries on or after this date
   -e, --end DATE         report on entries prior to this date
   -p, --period EXPR      report on entries during the specified period
                          and/or with the specified reporting interval
   -C, --cleared          report only on cleared entries
   -R, --real             report only on real (non-virtual) transactions
 
   Output customization:
   -B, --basis, --cost    report cost of commodities
   -d, --display EXPR     display only transactions matching EXPR (limited support)
   -E, --empty            show empty/zero things which are normally elided
   --no-total             balance report: hide the final total
   -W, --weekly           register report: show weekly summary
   -M, --monthly          register report: show monthly summary
   -Y, --yearly           register report: show yearly summary

   Misc:
   -V, --version          show version information
   -v, --verbose          show verbose test output
   --debug                show some debug output 
   --debug-no-ui          run ui commands with no output

We handle (almost) the full period expression syntax, and very limited
display expressions consisting of a simple date predicate. Also the
following new commands are supported::

   ui                     a simple interactive text ui (only on unix platforms)
   web                    a simple web ui
   test                   run self-tests

Other differences
.................

* hledger calls the "note" field "description"
* hledger recognises description and negative patterns by  "desc:" and "not:" prefixes,
  unlike ledger 3's free-form parser
* hledger keeps differently-priced amounts of the same commodity separate
* hledger doesn't require a space before command-line option values, eg: -f-
* hledger's weekly reporting intervals always start on mondays
* hledger shows start and end dates of the intervals requested, not just the span containing data
* hledger period expressions don't support "biweekly", "bimonthly", or "every N days/weeks/..." 
* hledger always shows timelog balances in hours
* hledger splits multi-day timelog sessions at midnight
* hledger register report always sorts transactions by date
* hledger doesn't show description comments as part of the description
* hledger print puts a blank line after the entry, not before it
