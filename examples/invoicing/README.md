Example files related to invoicing and billing:

- invoice-script - a somewhat flexible bash/pandoc script for generating HTML and PDF invoices from hledger data, 
  based on SM's invoicing setup (2022)

- makefile - a simpler make/pandoc script for generating HTML and PDF invoices, with less hledger integration,
  based on SM's previous setup (2021)

- some examples of invoicing-related journal entries

The SM scripts above aim to have a pretty good likelihood of working and being useful for others,
but they try to automate repetitive steps in my process as much as possible,
so they may try to run emacs, append to your journal, or git commit it;
read them before running, and adapt for your needs.
