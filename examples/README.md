Here in examples/ you'll find a mixed bag of sample journals, time logs, CSV rules, scripts, etc.
Like the Cookbook docs, these vary in age and quality; "examples" here does not mean "exemplary".
Some may be ready to use; some are to be studied and adapted; some are just for interest; some are outdated and best ignored.

The content here is not necessarily stable but here are some subcategories as of 2024-01:

- **budgeting** - some budgeting-related journals
- **costs** - some examples of cost notation
