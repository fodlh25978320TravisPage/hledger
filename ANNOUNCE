I'm pleased to announce version 0.16 of the hledger packages, a bugfix
and polish release. (This may become the pattern for even-numbered
releases in future.)

hledger is a library and set of user tools for working with financial
data (or anything that can be tracked in a double-entry accounting
ledger.) It is a haskell port and friendly fork of John Wiegley's
Ledger. hledger provides command-line, curses and web interfaces, and
aims to be a reliable, practical tool for daily use.  Given a plain
text file describing transactions of money or any other commodity, it
will print the chart of accounts, account balances, or just the
transactions you're interested in.  It can also help you record new
transactions, or convert CSV data from your bank.

Home: http://hledger.org

To install: cabal update, cabal install hledger. Optional add-ons:
hledger-web hledger-vty hledger-chart hledger-interest.

Pre-built platform-specific binaries, which are time-consuming to make
and support, are provided on request to financial donors - a great way
to give back and support the project! http://hledger.org/DOWNLOAD.html

Release notes for 0.16:

  * cli: strip the -- when calling add-on commands, so their options
    work (#64)

  * cli: hledger ADDONCOMMAND --version now shows add-on command's
    version

  * cli: only the add and web commands auto-create the journal file

  * cli: give a less confusing error if LEDGER_FILE contains a literal
    tilde

  * add: clearer prompts, more validation, use . to end also

  * add: avoid excess whitespace between transactions (#46)

  * balance: ledger compatibility fix: don't elide parent accounts
    with multiple displayed subaccounts

  * convert: always order converted transactions by date

  * register: show more useful range of intervals with --empty and a
    query pattern

  * print, web: always show both dates, ignoring --effective (#42)

  * web: production builds (the default with cabal install) now have
    all content embedded and no longer need to create support files.
    Dev builds (cabal install -f-production, or make bin/hledger-web)
    look for the web files at a simpler path, ./static/ (#63)

  * web: update to yesod 0.9

  * web: obey at least some command-line options, like --cost

  * web: adjust the default base url when a custom port is specified

  * web: prevent an infinite redirect when custom base url has a
    trailing slash

  * web: fix "not:'multi word'" patterns

  * web: hide old title and search form when adding/editing

  * web: adjust --help to indicate command-line arguments are not
    expected

  * web: don't bother running cli unit tests at startup
