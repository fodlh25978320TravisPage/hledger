I'm pleased to announce version 0.18 of hledger.

hledger (http://hledger.org) is a haskell library, command-line tool and
web application for working with financial data (or anything that can be
tracked numerically in an accounting journal). It is inspired by and
compatible with John Wiegley's Ledger. hledger reads a plain text file
describing transactions and lets you query account balances or transaction
details by various criteria.  It can also help you record new
transactions, or convert CSV data from your bank.

Release notes (http://hledger.org/NEWS.html):

  * web: hledger-web is now based on yesod 1.0

  * web: fix js error breaking second use of add form (#72)

  * web: make `yesod devel` work

  * the command-line now supports a more powerful query language, consistent with the web UI

  * hledger now fully supports tags (aka metadata) on both transactions and postings, and querying by tag or tag value

  * new commands `incomestatement`, `balancesheet`, and `cashflow` provide basic financial statements under certain conditions

  * format conversion is now done on demand, and the convert command has been dropped. So instead of
    `hledger convert FILE.csv` just do `hledger -f FILE.csv print` or any other command.
    You can also pipe any supported format into `hledger -f- CMD` and hledger will try to do the right thing.

  * support for GHC 6.12 has been dropped; this release has been tested with GHC 7.0.4, 7.2.2, and 7.4.1

  * unicode is now handled properly on all supported GHC versions

  * API and internal cleanups
