hledger is a command-line tool and haskell library for tracking
financial transactions, which are stored in a human-readable plain
text format. In addition to reporting, it can also help you record new
transactions, or convert CSV data from your bank. Add-on packages
include hledger-web, a web interface. hledger is inspired by and
compatible with John Wiegley's Ledger. For more, see http://hledger.org .
