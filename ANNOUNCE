I'm pleased to announce the release of hledger and hledger-web 0.18.1 (in
time for Debian wheezy!)

hledger (http://hledger.org) is a haskell library, command-line tool and
web application for tracking and analyzing financial transactions.  It
reads a plain text file describing transactions and lets you query account
balances or activity by various criteria.  It can also help you record new
transactions, or convert CSV data from your bank. hledger is inspired by
and compatible with John Wiegley's Ledger.

Installation:

  cabal update; cabal install hledger [hledger-web]

ready-to-run binary for your platform: http://hledger.org/DOWNLOAD.html
