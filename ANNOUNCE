I have released hledger 0.19.1 to fix an arithmetic bug with total prices
(thanks to Thierry Daucourt for reporting it).

Release notes:

  * 87: fix an arithmetic and transaction balancing bug with multiple
    total-priced amounts ( @@ PRICE )

  * parsing: ignore ledger-style balance assertions ( = BAL ) and fixed
    lot price declarations ( {= PRICE} )

hledger is a command-line tool and haskell library for tracking
financial transactions, which are stored in a human-readable plain
text format. In addition to reporting, it can also help you record new
transactions, or convert CSV data from your bank. Add-on packages
include hledger-web, a web interface. hledger is inspired by and
compatible with John Wiegley's Ledger. For more, see http://hledger.org .

Install it:

cabal update; cabal install hledger .
