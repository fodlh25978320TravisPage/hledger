Interesting/historical binaries are kept here, such as:

- Optimised cabal builds, copied here from cabal's bin directory.
- Old versions, with the -X.Y suffix. Used for performance benchmarking.
- Builds for other platforms, with a -PLATFORM-ARCH suffix, maybe compressed for download.
- Non-optimised developer builds compiled with make (*dev).
  Used during development for quicker, multi-package, and on-change compilation.
- cabal and/or make builds with profiling enabled (*-prof).
  Used for investigating time and space usage.
