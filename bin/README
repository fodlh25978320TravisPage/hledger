hledger add-on commands, hledger-related scripts, developer builds.

Scripts named hledger-* are hledger add-on commands. You can run them directly,
or via "hledger [HLEDGEROPTS] ADDONCMD [-- ADDONOPTS]". You should:
1. add this directory to your $PATH
2. ensure the scripts have executable permission (they should already, at least on unix)
3. optionally, compile them for quicker startup

Other hledger-related scripts include bash aliases, makefile examples, etc.

hledger development-related binaries also are stored here, such as
old versions for benchmarking, and platform-specific binaries.
