# Symlink this as hie.yaml to force HLS to use the stack yaml/ghc mentioned below.
# This works better than relying on HLS's implicit cradle, which doesn't work well
# with multi-package projects (opening a file from a second package breaks HLS).
# XXX Circa HLS 1.9.1.0 and GHC 9.4, this does not work.
#
# Does it force HLS to use stack in all cases ? Even if cabal's dist* directories are present ?
# More on cradle selection:
# > the heuristic is `cabal.project + dist-newstyle > stack.yaml + .stack-work > cabal.project > stack.yaml > .cabal file`
# > would it ever switch to cabal because it's having trouble building with stack ?
# > no, the heuristic only accounts for static things, such as which binaries are installed, the existence of these project files and pre-existing compilation artefacts.

# Here's a more recent one: https://github.com/keithfancher/tvmv/blob/master/hie.yaml

cradle:
  stack:

    # You can specify one of the other stack*.yaml files/GHC versions here if you prefer.
    stackYaml: "stack.yaml"

    # Declare which component the various files/directories belong to.
    # When there is a hie.yaml, this must be done explicitly
    # (a current limitation of HLS with multi-package stack projects).

    # The components: line is necessary when stackYaml: is defined above, apparently.
