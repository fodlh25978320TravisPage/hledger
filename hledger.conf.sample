# An example hledger config file for you to customise.
# This declares extra options/arguments to be added to your hledger commands.
# Save as ~/.hledger.conf, or ~/.config/hledger/hledger.conf, or hledger.conf
# in or above your current directory, and hledger will use it automatically.
# Or you can choose a config file with --conf.
# Or you can turn a config file like this one into a script, by adding
# a shebang line like `#!/usr/bin/env -S hledger --conf` at the top.
#
# Automatic config files are convenient, but have a cost: it's easy to confuse
# yourself, disrupt reports, or break scripts/applications which use hledger.
# If you choose to use one, be careful about what you put in it.
# If a command is not working as expected, run it with `--debug` to troubleshoot.
# To avoid using a config file, run with `-n` (short for `--no-conf`).


# 1. General options. These will be used with all commands which support them.

# Show prettier tables in reports.
# Recommended unless your font doesn't support box drawing characters.
--pretty

# Postpone balance assertions until you use -s or `hledger check assertions`.
# This means there's less need to add -I while piping or fixing problems.
--ignore-assertions

# Always infer these things ? Why not.
--infer-costs
--infer-market-prices
#--infer-equity


# 2. Command-specific options.

--explicit     # show inferred amounts
--show-costs   # show inferred costs

# Set your preferred options for the balance commands.

# You can also set options for add-on commands (run by `hledger ADDONCMD`).
